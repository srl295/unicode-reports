  <h2>1 <a name="Introduction" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

  <p>The concept of <i>script</i> is a key organizational principle for
    the Unicode Standard [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]. This annex
    introduces the general concept of script and the specific ways in which the concept
    is used in the standard. Two character properties, Script and Script_Extensions, are
    then specified in detail.</p>
  <p>A <i>script</i> is a collection of letters and other written signs that generally has the following attributes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The written elements share a common graphological style and history.</li>
    <li>The collection is used (in full, or as a subset) to represent textual information in a writing system for one or more languages.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example, the Russian language is written with a distinctive set of letters, as well as other marks or symbols that together form a subset of the <em>Cyrillic</em> script. Other languages using the Cyrillic script, such as Ukrainian or Serbian, employ a different subset of those letters.</p>
  <p>Normally, the letter shapes of one script are unrelated to those of another script. So, for example, the letter
    shapes of the Cyrillic script share nothing in common with the letter shapes of the Hebrew script.
    However, writing systems may be historically related to each other, in which case there are often
    systematic <i>similarities</i> in letter shapes and occasional identical shapes. So because the
    Cyrillic script is historically related to the Greek script, those two scripts share a significant
    number of letter forms.</p>
  <p>A script may also explicitly borrow letters from another script. For example, 
  some writing systems that use the Cyrillic script have borrowed letter forms from the Latin script.
  Furthermore, letter forms may show accidental similarity in shapes: a simple line or circle used
  as a letter, for example, could have been independently created many times in the history of the
  development of writing systems.</p>
  <p>The writing system for a language occasionally employs more than one script.
    The best known example is the Japanese language, whose writing system uses four scripts: the Han ideographs (<i>kanji</i>), as well as the Hiragana and Katakana syllabaries, but also a subset of the Latin letters.</p>
  <p>Some languages may have competing writing systems that use different scripts,
    or change scripts from one historical period to another. For example, the Turkish language was historically written in the Arabic script but is now written using the Latin script. For many other languages there are similar cases, where an historical writing system used one script, while a modern writing system for the same language may use a different script.</p>
  <p>Some scripts, such as the Latin script or the Arabic script, have an historically
  developed cosmopolitan status, and are used for the representation of the
  writing systems of hundreds or even thousands of different languages.
  The <i>script</i> in such cases consists of the complete set of letters and
  other signs needed to represent <i>all</i> of the writing systems covered,
  which may include historical as well as modern text forms, rather than simply
  being a single alphabet or other set of graphic symbols needed for writing a single language.</p>

  <h3>1.1 <a name="Classification" href="#Classification">Examples of Script Classification</a></h3>
  <p>Independent of its use by the Unicode Standard, there are distinct needs for classification by script. For example, writing systems can be classified by the script or scripts they use. In cases of continuous historical derivation of scripts from predecessor scripts, an existing graphological classification may consider a writing system to be using a variant of an ancestor script, whereas the Unicode Standard may give each historic stage its own script identity for the purposes of character encoding.</p>
  <p>In another example, bibliographers need to catalog documents by the 
	primary script in which they are written. In so doing, bibliographers often ignore small inclusions of other scripts in 
	the form of 
	quoted material, for the purpose of catalog identification. Conversely, significant 
	differences in writing style for the same script may be reflected in the 
	bibliographical classification—for example, Fraktur or Gaelic styles for the Latin script.
  Such stylistic distinctions are ignored in the Unicode Standard, which treats them as presentation styles of the Latin script.</p>
<p>Bibliographers also assign a single classification code for Japanese or Korean documents, even though the respective writing systems use a mix of scripts. Such single codes have also proven useful as a shorthand notation for describing the repertoires of characters needed when supporting identifiers, as for the Internationalized Domain Names (IDN).</p>

<h3>1.2 <a name="Script_Identity" href="#Script_Identity">Script Identity and Unicode</a></h3>
<p>The Unicode Standard fundamentally considers characters as elements of scripts in making encoding decisions. For example, when a letter is borrowed from one script into another, it often is encoded again as a distinct element of the borrowing script. This occurs most often in the case for letters. For punctuation and other similar marks, the decision may instead be made to explicitly designate a character for common use with all scripts, or to document its use with a defined subset of all scripts.</p>
<p>In addition to letters, the Unicode Standard includes
    many graphic symbols which fall outside the scope of particular writing
    systems and are not associated with particular scripts. For example, there are commonly used punctuation marks
    such as commas and quotation marks that are widely shared across scripts. The same consideration applies to the European digits "1", "2", "3", .... The Unicode Standard also contains many combining
    marks intended to be used in multiple writing systems, as well as symbols
    for notational systems like mathematics that have their own rules and
  identity independent of writing systems for particular languages.</p>

<h3>1.3 <a name="Scripts_and_Blocks" href="#Scripts_and_Blocks">Scripts and Blocks</a></h3>
<p>Unicode characters are  divided into non-overlapping ranges called 
  blocks 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Blocks">Blocks</a>]. Many of these blocks have a name derived from
  a script name, because 
  characters of that script are primarily encoded in that block. 
  However, blocks and scripts differ in the following 
  ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blocks are simply ranges, and often contain code points that are unassigned.</li>
  <li>Characters from the same script may be encoded in several different blocks.</li>
  <li>Characters from different scripts may be encoded in the same block.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result,  using the  block names as simplistic substitute for script identity generally leads to poor results.
  For example, see <i>Annex A, Character Blocks</i>, in 
  Unicode Technical Standard #18, "Unicode Regular Expressions" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>].</p>

<h3>1.4 <a name="Script_Class_Proc" href="#Script_Class_Proc">Script Classification in Text Processing</a></h3>
<p>In text processing the classification of text by script is by necessity more fine-grained than when cataloging documents. The classification by script is essential for a 
  variety of tasks that need to analyze a piece of text and determine what 
  parts of it are in which script. Examples include regular expressions or 
  assigning different fonts to parts of a plain text stream based on the prevailing script. For all of these tasks, the challenge is to break a text into script runs, or stretches of text that are all treated as belonging to the same script.</p>
<p>Script information is also taken into consideration 
  in collation, so that strings  are grouped by script when sorted. To that end, the Default Unicode Collation Element Table (DUCET) 
  assigns letters of different scripts different ranges of primary sort weights. However, numbers, symbols, and punctuation are not 
  grouped with the letters. For the purposes of ordering, therefore, explicit script identity is 
  most significant for the letters. For more information, see Unicode 
  Technical Standard #10, “Unicode Collation Algorithm”
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS10">UTS10</a>].</p>
<p>These examples demonstrate that 
  the use of <i>script</i> (and to a certain extent, its exact specification) depends on the intended purposes 
  of the classification. <i><a href="#Classification_Table">Table 1</a></i> summarizes 
  some of the purposes for which text elements can be classified by 
  script</p>

<h3>1.5 <a name="Classification_by_Script" href="#Classification_by_Script">Classification of Text by Script Property</a></h3>
<p>The exact way in which one uses script information about text depends
    on the kind of processing that is involved. In addition to being normally less-fine-grained, bibliographical, graphological, or historical 
	classifications of scripts need different distinctions than common text processing-related tasks. To assist in the development of interoperable implementations for text
  processing that depends on script classification, the Unicode Standard defines
  two character properties, Script and Script_Extensions.</p>
<p>The Script property assigns a single value to each character, either explicitly associating it with a particular script, or assigning one of several special values. The Script property is discussed in detail in Section 2, <i><a href="#Script">The Script Property</a></i>. The Script_Extensions property builds on this model, by better documenting cases where characters are neither used solely with members of a single script nor shared universally. The Script_Extensions property is unusual in that each of its values is a set of Script values. The Script_Extensions property is discussed in detail in 
  Section 3, <i><a href="#Script_Extensions">The Script_Extensions Property</a></i>.</p>
<p>The special property values required to support text-processing needs are different from those needed in other classifications. For example, when 
  bibliographers are unable to determine the script of a document, they may 
  classify it using a special value for <b>Unknown</b>. In text processing, 
  the identities of all characters are normally known, but some characters may 
  be 
  shared across scripts or attached to any character, thus requiring 
  special values for <b>Common</b> and <b>Inherited</b>.</p>
<p>Despite these differences in focus, the vast majority of 
	Unicode Script property values correspond more or less directly to the script identifiers used by bibliographers 
  and others.</p>
<p>This annex
  documents the definition and use of those properties and describes the
  data files in the Unicode Character Database [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UCD">UCD</a>]
  that specify exact values of those properties for all Unicode characters.</p>

<h3>1.6 <a name="Out_of_Scope" href="#Out_of_Scope">Usage Not Reflected in the Script Property</a></h3>
<p>Many characters are regularly used out of their normal contexts
        for specialized purposes&#x2014;for example, for pedagogical use or as part of
        mathematical, scientific, or scholarly notations. Such uses are not reflected in
        the assignment of values for either the Script or Script_Extensions properties,
        because those properties aim rather to reflect ordinary and common usage of
        characters with a script (or set of scripts). Implementers are cautioned
        that such "out-of-context" usage of characters does exist and needs to be
        supported where required, regardless of the Script and Script_Extensions
        property values for a given character.</p>
	
<h2>2 <a name="Script" href="#Script">The Script Property</a></h2>
	
  <h3>2.1 <a name="Special_Explicit"></a><a name="Script_Values" href="#Script_Values">Script Property Values</a></h3>

  <p>The Script property is an enumerated property of type <i>catalog</i>. Its
    values form a full partition of the codespace: every Unicode code point 
	is assigned a single Script property value. This value is
  either the explicit value for a specific script, such 
  as <b>Cyrillic,</b> or is one of the following three special values:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Inherited</b>—for 
		characters that may be used with multiple scripts, and that inherit their 
		script from a preceding base character. These include nonspacing combining marks 
		and enclosing combining marks, as well as U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER and U+200D
    ZERO WIDTH JOINER.</li> 
		<li><b>Common</b>—for other characters that may be used with multiple scripts.</li>
		<li><b>Unknown</b>—for unassigned, private-use, 
		noncharacter, and surrogate code points.</li>
	</ul>
  <p>Collectively, these three special values are called <i>implicit</i> values,
    in contrast to all other Script property values, which each refer to one specific
    script and which are called <i>explicit</i> values.</p>

  <p>As new scripts are 
	added to the standard, explicit Script property values will be added to the enumeration. 
  Implementations are advised to allow for this growth in enumerated values. See 
	also Section 2.3, 
  <i><a href="#Assignment_Script_Values">Initial Assignment of Script Property Values</a></i>.</p>
	
  <p>The implicit values <b>Common</b> or <b>Inherited</b> do not 
  indicate <em>which</em> scripts a character is used with&#x2014;only that the character is 
  used with more than one script. For example, U+30FC ( ー ) KATAKANA-HIRAGANA PROLONGED 
  SOUND MARK is shared between Hiragana and Katakana and is not typically used with 
  other scripts, such as Latin or Greek. For many applications such a coarse classification may be
	insufficient; they require further detailed information. For example, a character picker
	application which organizes characters into visual buckets by script may need to
	show a <b>Common</b> script character in two or more buckets, depending on which
	particular scripts use that character. For data on which scripts a character
  is commonly used with, 
  see Section 3, <i><a href="#Script_Extensions">The Script_Extensions Property</a></i>.</p>

  <p>A value of <b>Inherited</b> means that the character is treated as if 
    it had the Script property value of a preceding base character. 
    (See Section 5.2, <i><a href="#Nonspacing_Marks">Handling Combining Marks</a></i>.) 
    Where the character is not part of a combining sequence, as is the case for 
    U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER and U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER, 
    there are special script inheritance rules for use in text run processing.</p>
	
  <p>The Script property values assigned for all characters are specified
   in the file Scripts.txt [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Data24">Data24</a>] in the Unicode Character 
  Database [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UCD">UCD</a>].

	<p>In some cases the match between the Script property values 
    and the ISO 15924 codes is not precise, because the goals are somewhat 
    different. ISO 15924 is aimed primarily at the bibliographic identification 
    of scripts; consequently, it occasionally identifies varieties of scripts 
    that may be useful for book cataloging, but that are not considered 
    distinct scripts in the Unicode Standard. For example, ISO 15924 has 
    separate script codes for the Fraktur and Gaelic varieties of the Latin 
    script. Such codes for script varieties are shown in parentheses
    in <i><a href="#Script_Values_Table">Table 3</a></i>.</p>
	<p>Where there are no corresponding ISO 15924 codes,  
    private-use codes starting with the letter Q are used. Such 
    values are likely to change in the future. In such a case, the Q-names will 
    be retained as aliases in the file [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#PropValue">PropValue</a>] 
    for backward compatibility. For example, the older Script property value Qaai was retained 
    as an alias for <b>Inherited</b>, when the newly defined script code Zinh was added to ISO 15924
    and then used as the preferred short name for <b>Inherited</b> starting in Unicode 5.2.</p>
    
	<h3>2.3 <a name="Values"></a><a name="Assignment_Script_Values" href="#Assignment_Script_Values">Initial Assignment of Script Property Values</a></h3>
	
	<p>New characters and scripts are continually added to the 
	Unicode Standard. The following 
	principle determines the assignment of Script property values 
	for existing
	characters and for characters that are newly added to the Unicode Standard:</p>
	<ol type="A">
		<li>
		If a character is only regularly used in one script, 
		it takes the Script property value for that script</li>
	<li>Otherwise, if the predominant use of the character is in one script,
      but it is also used in others, then it takes the Script property value associated
      with that predominant use</li>
  <li>Otherwise, nonspacing marks (Mn, Me) and zero width joiner/non-joiner are
  <b>Inherited</b></li>
  <li>Otherwise, use <b>Common</b></li>
	</ol>
  <p>An example of criterion "B" would be the occasional use of an Arabic
    character in a related minor-use or historic script. In such a case, the predominant
    use would still be for Arabic, and the Script property value is determined to be <b>Arabic</b>,
    rather than <b>Common</b>. The determination of predominant use in such cases is
    based in part on an estimation of likely frequency of use.
    This choice is designed to maximize the usefulness of the Script property value
    for determination of script runs in text, for regular expressions, and so on, without having to branch to
    more elaborate processing to determine how to handle <b>Common</b> property values by
    examining the Script_Extensions value set in these edge cases. The choice of
    an explicit Script property value, instead of <b>Common</b> or <b>Inherited</b>, in these edges cases is
    done when, in the judgement of the Unicode Technical Committee, that explicit
    Script property value is a reasonable default. However, 
  some characters that are definitely members of a given script, 
  based on their forms and history, nevertheless are assigned one of the implicit Script values
  instead.</p>

  <p>Although Braille is not a script in the same sense as 
  Latin or Greek, it is given an explicit Script property value. 
  This is useful for various applications for which these Script property values are 
  intended, such as matching spans of similar characters in regular expressions.</p>

	<p>Script values are not immutable. As more data on the usage of individual characters 
  is collected, the Script property value assigned to a character may change. 
  Rarely would a character change from one specific script
  to another. However, if it 
  becomes established that a character is regularly used with more than one 
  script, it will be assigned the <b>Common</b> 
  or <b>Inherited</b> Script property value. Similarly, if it becomes
  established that a character is regularly used with only a single, specific script,
  it will be assigned an explicit Script property value. The occasional use of character from one script
  in the context of another script, as for instance the citation of a Greek letter
  used as a mathematical constant in the midst of Latin text, or the use of a Latin
  letter in the midst of Han text, is not considered sufficient evidence of
  "regular use" requiring a designation of <b>Common</b> Script property value.
  It is also possible for a character, once given a <b>Common</b> or <b>Inherited</b>
  Script property value, upon further research, to be changed to a specific script,
  instead.</p>
	
	<h3>2.4 <a name="Script_Designators" href="#Script_Designators">Script 
	Designators in Character and Block Names</a></h3>
	
	<p>Many character names contain a script designator
	as their first element(s). For example:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li><b>LATIN</b> SMALL LETTER S</li>
	<li><b>KATAKANA</b> LETTER SA</li>
	<li><b>NEW TAI LUE</b> LETTER LOW SA</li>
	<li><b>PHAGS-PA</b> LETTER SA</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Character names are guaranteed to be unique even when ignoring case
	differences and the presence of SPACE 
	or HYPHEN-MINUS. Underscores are not
	used in character names. In practice, this means that
	script designators are also unique, and, because
	they are a part of character names, they are limited to 
	the same characters used in character names:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Latin letters A–Z</li>
		<li>Digits 0–9</li>
		<li>SPACE and medial HYPHEN-MINUS</li>
  </ul>
        
        <p>Digits do not actually occur in script designators used
        in character names.</p>
        
	<p>Many block names, for example, "Latin-1 Supplement", also
	contain script designators. These script designators are closely (but not precisely)
	aligned with the script designators used for character names in the corresponding
	blocks. Similar restrictions apply to script designators as part of 
	block names, except that there is no restriction on
	the case of letters.</p>
	
	<h3>2.5 <a name="Script_Value_Aliases" href="#Script_Value_Aliases">Script Property Value Aliases</a></h3>
	
	<p>In addition to short names derived from ISO 15924 script codes,
	as discussed in <i>Section 2.2, <a href="#Relation_To_ISO15924">Relation to ISO 15924 Codes</a></i>, each Script property value is also given a long name as a Script
	property value alias. These long names are also listed in 
	[<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#PropValue">PropValue</a>].
	They are constructed to be appropriate for use as identifiers. The long or short
	property value aliases are the identifiers that should
	be used in regular expressions and similar usages.</p>

	<p>Except for the implicit Script property values
	<b>Common</b> and <b>Inherited</b>, the long name aliases usually correspond to the
	script designators, with the replacement of SPACE 
	or HYPHEN-MINUS by underscores, and titlecasing
	each subpart of the resulting identifier, for consistency with the conventions used
	for aliases for other Unicode character properties. For example:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li><b>Latin</b></li>
	<li><b>Katakana</b></li>
	<li><b>New_Tai_Lue</b></li>
	<li><b>Phags_Pa</b></li>
	</ul>

        <p>As for all property aliases, Script property value aliases
        are guaranteed to be unique within their respective namespace. 
        See the Character Encoding Stability Policies [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Stability">Stability</a>]
        for details. When comparing Script property value aliases, loose matching criteria
        which ignore case differences and the presence of spaces, hyphens, and underscores,
        should be used. See <i>Section 5.9, Matching Rules</i>, in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX44">UAX44</a>]
        for explanation of loose matching criteria.</p>
        
	<h3>2.6 <a name="Script_Names" href="#Script_Names">Script Names</a></h3>
	
	<p>The term <i>script name</i> is no longer used as part of
	the formal specification of the Unicode Script property because it tends to
	be used informally in several ambiguous senses:</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li>To designate the orthographic name of a script in the Unicode Standard.
            For example: <b>chirilică</b>, <b>Кириллица</b>, or <b>キリル文字</b> for <b>Cyrillic</b> (Cyrl).
	    Even in English, such names may occasionally include characters not allowed in script
	    designators or Script property values. For example: <b>Hanun&oacute;o</b> 
	    or <b>N'Ko</b></li>
	<li>To designate any variety of writing, some of which may have ISO 15924
	    script variety codes, such as the <b>Gaelic</b> script, and some of which
	    may not, such as the <b>Hebrew Cursive</b> script.</li>
	<li>As a synonym of the term <i>script designator</i> as it appears in
	    character or block names. For example: <b>HANUNOO</b>
	    or <b>NKO</b></li>
	<li>As a synonym of the long name alternate of <i>Script property value aliases</i>. 
	    For example: <b>Hanunoo</b> (as opposed to the script code <b>Hano</b>) or <b>Nko</b>
	    (as opposed to the script code <b>Nkoo</b>)</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Because of these ambiguities, in Unicode contexts where precision
	of denotation is required, use of the terms <i>Script property value</i> or
	<i>script designator</i>, whichever may be appropriate, is preferred.</p>
        
	<h3>2.7 <a name="Script_Anomalies" href="#Script_Anomalies">Script Anomalies</a></h3>
        
    <p>There are a number of compatibility symbols derived from East Asian character sets
      which have the Script property value <b>Common</b> but whose compatibility decompositions
      contain characters with other Script property values. In particular, the parenthesized ideographs,
      circled ideographs, Japanese era name symbols, and Chinese telegraph symbols
      in the 3200..33FF range contain Han ideographs, and the squared Latin abbreviation
      symbols in the same range contain Latin (and occasional Greek) letters. Examples
      of such characters are listed in <i><a href="#Common_EastAsian_Table">Table 4</a></i>. 
      Some of these characters have different scripts in their compatibility 
      decompositions. This means that script extents calculated on the basis of the script property
      value of the symbols themselves will differ from script extents calculated on
      NFKD normalized text, in which these characters decompose into sequences including
      the Han and/or Latin characters.</p>

    <p>The UTC has determined that because these symbols may be used with multiple
      scripts in Chinese, Japanese, and/or Korean contexts, their Script property value should
      simply be left as <b>Common</b>. There are other, more reliable clues about
      the behavior of these compatibility symbols, such as their association with
      East Asian character sets, which can be used by rendering systems to assure
      their appropriate display and appropriate font choice. This determination is
      somewhat different from that for the more script-specific parenthesized and
      circled Hangul and Katakana symbols in the same range, which <i>are</i> given
      specific Script property values. Examples of such
      characters are shown in <i><a href="#Common_KanaHangul_Table">Table 5</a></i>.</p>

      <p>There are other symbols not constrained to primary use in East Asian contexts,
      which have the <b>Common</b> script, but where some users would expect to have a specific
      script. Examples are shown in <i><a href="#Common_Other_Table">Table 6</a></i>. Symbols in such cases are assigned to the <b>Common</b> script
      because they may be used with a wide variety of scripts, and are not
      necessarily limited to the script values of their compatibility decompositions.</p>

      <p>At this point keeping the Script property value stable for
      these compatibility symbols is more useful for implementers than attempting
      to reconcile these distinctions in treatment by modifying values for them. 
      Implementations that wish to have Script property values that are preserved over
      compatibility equivalence would tailor the Script property values for these
      characters.</p>

  <h2>3 <a name="ScriptX"></a><a name="Script_Extensions" href="#Script_Extensions">The Script_Extensions Property</a></h2>
          
        <p>Where a character is commonly used in the context of
        several scripts, it is often desirable to know more precisely
        in which script context such characters can be expected to
        occur. The implicit Script property values <b>Common</b> and
        <b>Inherited</b> were originally designed simply to indicate
        that a character, such as a punctuation mark, occurs widely
        in conjunction with many scripts, rather than being associated
        with use for just one script. However, many of the characters that are 
        assigned a value of <b>Common</b> or
        <b>Inherited</b> are not commonly used with
        <i>all</i> scripts, but rather only with a limited set of scripts.
        In cases where the list of such scripts can be explicitly
        enumerated, it can help various processing to have the list
        specified. Such lists of use by a character across several scripts
        are documented with
        the Script_Extensions (scx) property.</p> 

  <p>The Script_Extensions property is implemented as sets of Script
    property values, known as <i>scx sets</i> ("Es Cee Ex sets"). <i><a href="#Scx_Example_Table">Table 7</a></i>
        gives examples of scx sets for various Unicode code points, along with
        their Script and General_Category property values. Note that for
        completeness, default values for scx sets are given for all Unicode code
        points, including reserved code points and noncharacters. The details of
        assignment of scx set values are discussed further below.</p>

        Katakana scripts, but is not used in other scripts, so
        it is assigned an scx set value of {Hira Kana}. U+0640 ARABIC TATWEEL is used
        in Adlam, Mandaic, Manichaean, Psalter Pahlavi, Hanifi Rohingya, Sogdian, 
        and Syriac, as well as the Arabic script,
        but is not used with non-cursive scripts or with scripts unrelated to that
        family of writing systems, so it is assigned an
        scx set value of {Adlm Arab Mand Mani Phlp Rohg Sogd Syrc}.</p>

  <p>The Script_Extensions property is primarily 
  targeted at customary modern use of characters, and does not encompass technical usage such 
  as phonetic transcriptional systems or mathematics.</p>
   
  <h3>3.1 <a name="Script_Extensions_Def" href="#Script_Extensions_Def">Script_Extensions Property Values</a></h3>

<p>This section describes formal construction and constraints on the Script_Extensions (scx)
property values.</p>

<p>A. Each code point is associated with exactly one non-empty set
  of values of the sc property. This set is known as the code point's <i>scx set</i>.</p>

<p>Unlike most other character properties, all values of the scx property
  constitute sets of values.
The empty set is not allowed; the scx value for unassigned, private use, and non-character code
points is the set { <b>Unknown</b> }.</p>

<p>B. The elements of the scx set consist of an unordered list of unique values
  of the Script (sc) property values.</p>

<p>The scx values { <b>Latn Grek</b> } and { <b>Grek Latn</b> } are identical; for ease of
  comparison, the values in the sets may be sorted and listed in alphabetical
  order.</p>

<p>C. An scx set either contains a single implicit sc value or one or more
explicit sc values.</p>

<p>The vast
  majority of characters in the standard are used with only a single script. For those characters,
  the Script_Extensions property value is a set containing as its single member the
  Script property value for that character.</p>

<p>D. If the sc property value of a code point is explicit, then that
  value must be an element of the scx set for that code point as well.</p>

<p>Even though there is no formal constraint on the number
  of explicit values that may occur in an scx set, it is unlikely that any scx value would individually
  list even a majority of existing scripts. The implicit sc value <b>Common</b> is
  intended instead for use in those cases where a character is in very widespread use across
  many scripts.</p>

<p>There are no formal rules specifying when a particular sc value must
  be added to the scx set for a particular assigned character. Whether to document
  that a character is used with multiple scripts via the Script_Extensions property
  remains a judgment call, and is always based on the best information available
  to the Unicode Technical Committee.</p>

  
  <p>Occasionally, even characters that have a Script property value of <b>Common</b> or
  <b>Inherited</b> might have a Script_Extensions property value containing only a
  single script. This does not mean that those characters are
  used solely with a single script&#x2014;rather, such characters are known or strongly suspected of being
  used with multiple scripts. However, reliable information is lacking regarding
  which other scripts belong in this set. Examples illustrating this can be seen
  in <i><a href="#Scx_Example_Table">Table 7</a></i>, where the Samavedic tone mark U+1CD0 VEDIC TONE KARSHANA is attested
  at least for Devanagari, Bengali, Kannada, and Grantha, but where U+1CD1 VEDIC TONE SHARA is
  only known (for now) to occur in Devanagari Samavedic texts. The Script_Extensions property
  for such characters will be updated in future versions of the standard, if 
  better information becomes available.</p>
   
  <p>Conversely, characters for which the Script_Extensions property
  value contains multiple Script property values typically have a Script property value of
  either <b>Common</b> or <b>Inherited</b>.
  However, in some cases, a character belonging to a particular script may
  be borrowed for use with one or more other scripts. While the Script property value
  for such a borrowed character would be the same as the script it is primarily used with, the Script_Extensions
  property value at times will also include additional scripts. Examples
  can be seen in <i><a href="#Scx_Example_Table">Table 7</a></i> for shared sets of digits. It
  is common for one Indic script to use digits from another script; Devanagari digits are
  known, for example, to also be used in Dogra, Kaithi and Mahajani. As a result 
  of this kind of borrowing across scripts, there is no guarantee that it will always
  be true that:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <pre>
Script_Extensions(c) &#x2260; {Script(c)} &#x2192; (Script(c) = <b>Common</b>) &#x2228; (Script(c) = <b>Inherited</b>)</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p><i><a href="#Scx_Bad_Example_Table">Table 8</a></i> provides examples of scx sets 
    that are not allowed,
    according to the well-formedness rules for scx sets.</p>

  <p>The complete list of Script_Extensions scx set values are specified in the

  <h3>3.2 <a name="Assignment_ScriptX_Values" href="#Assignment_ScriptX_Values">Initial Assignment of 
    Script_Extensions Property Values</a></h3>
  
  <p>The following 
  principle determines the assignment of Script_Extensions property values 
  for existing
  characters and for characters that are newly added to the Unicode Standard:</p>
  <ol type="A">
        <li>If a character has the Script property value of <b>Common</b>
        or <b>Inherited</b>, and in principle might occur with almost any script,
        its Script_Extensions value is {<b>Common</b>} or {<b>Inherited</b>}, respectively</li>
  <li>If a character is regularly or occasionally used in more than one script,
                but such usage is limited to a small, enumerable list, then 
    the character takes the Script_Extensions property value consisting of the set of
                Script property values for each of those scripts</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the Script_Extensions property value defaults to a set containing
        a single value, the Script property value for that code point</li>
  </ol>
        
        <p>Examples of characters that have the Script property value of <b>Common</b>
        or <b>Inherited</b>, but in principle might occur with almost any script, would
        include many symbol characters. They simply get a Script_Extensions
        default value of {<b>Common</b>} or {<b>Inherited</b>}. Only when the common usage
        consists of a relatively small and well-determined list of scripts is it useful to
        enumerate that set explicitly for a Script_Extensions property value. In many
        cases such sets may involve shared typographical traditions between neighboring or
        related scripts. Note that assignment of an enumerated
        set of more than one Script property values to the Script_Extensions property value for a
        character can occur both in cases where that character has the Script property
        value <b>Common</b> or <b>Inherited</b> and in cases where it has an explicit Script property value
        such as <b>Arabic</b>.</p>
  <p>Script_Extensions property values are not immutable. As more data on the usage of 
  individual characters is collected, Script_Extensions property values may be adjusted.
        This may occur either as a result of the Script property value for the character
        being changed, or as a result of a determination that a given character is used
        with more (or fewer) scripts than earlier determined. The values can be expected 
        to change more frequently than many other Unicode 
  character properties, as more information is gleaned about the usage of given characters. 
  Thus, implementers should be prepared for enhancements and corrections to 
  the values whenever they upgrade to a new version of the property.</p>
  
<h2>4 <a name="Data_File" href="#Data_File">Data Files</a></h2>
	
  <p>The data files associated with the Unicode Script property are available 
    in the Unicode Character Database. See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Data24">Data24</a>].</p>

  <h3>4.1 <a name="Data_File_SC" href="#Data_File_SC">Scripts.txt</a></h3>

  <p>The format of this file is similar to that of Blocks.txt 
    [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Blocks">Blocks</a>]. The fields are separated by semicolons. The 
    first field contains either a single code point or the first and last code 
    points in a range separated by “..”. The second field provides the script property
    value for that range. The comment (after a #) indicates the General_Category and the character name. For each range, it gives the character count in square 
    brackets and uses the names for the first and last characters in the range. 
    For example:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>0B01;       Oriya # Mn       ORIYA SIGN CANDRABINDU
0B02..0B03; Oriya # Mc   [2] ORIYA SIGN ANUSVARA..ORIYA SIGN VISARGA</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The default value for the Script property is <b>Unknown</b>, given to all code points that are 
  not explicitly mentioned in the data file.</p>

  <h3>4.2 <a name="Data_File_SCX" href="#Data_File_SCX">ScriptExtensions.txt</a></h3>

  <p>The format of this data file is similar to Scripts.txt, except 
  that the second field contains a space-delimited list of short Script property values.
  That list defines the set of Script property values which constitute the
  Script_Extension property value for that code point. 
  For example:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre># Script_Extensions=Arab Syrc

064B..0655    ; Arab Syrc # Mn  [11] ARABIC FATHATAN..ARABIC HAMZA BELOW

# Script_Extensions=Adlm Arab Mand Mani Phlp Rohg Sogd Syrc

0640          ; Adlm Arab Mand Mani Phlp Rohg Sogd Syrc # Lm       ARABIC TATWEEL</pre>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>The default value for the Script_Extensions property for a code point not
  explicitly listed in ScriptExtensions.txt is an scx set containing one value: the Script property value
  of that code point.</p>

  <h3>4.3 <a name="Data_File_PVA" href="#Data_File_PVA">PropertyValueAliases.txt</a></h3>

  <p>This file provides the complete enumerated list of all Script property values: both long 
  and short names. As for all property value aliases, 
  the Script property values listed in the PropertyValueAliases.txt are not case sensitive, 
  and the presence of hyphen or 
  underscore is optional. The aliases are listed alphabetically, but that order is only
  a convenience for reference and is not otherwise significant. 
  See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#PropValue">PropValue</a>].</p>
  
  <h2>5 <a name="Usage_Model"></a><a name="Implementation" href="#Implementation">Implementation Notes</a></h2>

  <p>This section discusses various topics related to the implementation of the Script
    property and the Script_Extensions property.</p>

  <h3>5.1 <a name="Common" href="#Common">Handling Characters with the Common Script Property</a></h3>
  
  <p>In determining the boundaries of a run of text in a 
  given script, programs must
  resolve any of the special Script property values, such 
  as <b>Common,</b> based on the context of the surrounding characters. 
  A simple heuristic uses the script of the preceding character, which 
  works well in many cases. However, this may not always produce optimal 
  results. For example, in the text “... gamma (γ) is ...”, this 
  heuristic would cause matching parentheses to be in different scripts. </p>
  
  <p>Generally, paired punctuation, such as brackets or quotation marks, belongs 
  to the enclosing or outer level of the text and should therefore match the 
  script of the enclosing text. In addition, opening and closing elements of a 
  pair resolve to the same Script property values, where possible. The use of quotation 
  marks is language dependent; therefore it is not possible to tell from the 
  character code alone whether a particular quotation mark is used as an 
  opening or closing punctuation. For more information, see <i>Section 6.2, 
  General Punctuation,</i> of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
  <p>Some characters that are normally 
  used as paired punctuation may also be used singly. An example is U+2019
  RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK, which is also used as
  <i>apostrophe,</i> in which case it no longer acts as an enclosing 
  punctuation. An example from physics would be &lt;<span class="mathsym2">ψ</span>| 
  or |<span class="mathsym2">ψ</span>&gt;, where the enclosing 
  punctuation characters may not form consistent pairs.</p>
  
  <h3>5.2 <a name="Nonspacing_Marks" href="#Nonspacing_Marks">Handling Combining Marks</a></h3>
  
  <p>Implementations that determine the boundaries between 
  characters of given scripts should never break between a combining mark (a character with General_Category value of Mc, Mn or Me) and its base 
  character. Thus, for boundary determinations and similar sorts of processing, 
  a combining mark—whatever its Script property value—should inherit the script 
  property value of its base character. Spacing combining marks are typically only used 
  with one script and have the corresponding Script property value.</p>
  <p>The nonspacing marks normally have the  
  <b>Inherited</b> Script property value to 
      reflect the fact that their Script property value depends on the base character. 
      However, in cases where the best interpretation of a 
      nonspacing mark <i>in isolation</i> would be a specific script, its 
      Script property value may be different from <b>Inherited</b>. 
  For example, the Hebrew marks and 
  accents are used only with Hebrew characters and are therefore assigned the
  <b>Hebrew</b> Script property value.</p>

        <p>The recommended implementation strategy is to treat all the characters of
        a combining character sequence, including spacing combining marks, as
        having the Script property value of the first character in the sequence. This
        strategy can also be applied to implementations that use extended grapheme
        clusters; the differences between combining character
        sequences and extended
        grapheme clusters are not material for script resolution. For
        example, rendering generally works
        best if an entire combining character sequence can be treated as a segment
        having a single script, using one set of orthographic rules, and ideally
        using a single font for display. Because
        of this recommended strategy, even if a combining mark is really only used
        with a single script, it makes little difference in practice whether the
        mark has that particular Script property value or <b>Inherited</b>.</p>
        
        <p>In cases where the first (base) character itself 
        has the <b>Common</b> Script property value, and it is followed by one or more combining
        marks with a specific Script property value, such as the Hebrew marks, it may
        be even better for processing to let the base acquire the Script property value from the
        first mark. This would be the case, for example, if using a graphic symbol as
        a base to illustrate the placement of nonspacing marks in a particular script.
        This approach can be generalized by treating all the characters of a combining character
        sequence (or extended grapheme cluster)
        as having the Script property value of the first non-<b>Inherited</b>,
        non-<b>Common</b> character in the sequence if
        there is one, and otherwise treating all the characters as having the
        <b>Common</b> Script property value. See <i>Section 2.8, 
  <a href="#Multiple_Script_Values">Multiple Script Values</a></i>.</p>
        
        <p>Note that exceptional fallback for rendering may
        be required for defective combining character sequences or in some cases where
        a base character and a combining mark have different specific Script property values.
        For example, there may simply be no felicitous way to display a Devanagari
        combining vowel on a Mongolian consonant base.</p>
        
  <h3>5.3 <a name="Multiple_Script_Values" href="#Multiple_Script_Values">Multiple Script Values</a></h3>
  
  <p>More precise information about the use of a character with multiple 
  scripts is important for a number of different kinds of processing. The following examples 
  illustrate such cases:</p>
<p><strong>Example 1.</strong> Mixed script detection for spoofing.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Using the Script property alone, for example, will not detect that the
     U+30FC ( ー ) KATAKANA-HIRAGANA PROLONGED SOUND MARK (Script=<b>Common</b>) should not be mixed with Latin. See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS39">UTS39</a>] and [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS46">UTS46</a>].</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 2.</strong> Determination of script runs for text layout.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>U+30FC ( ー ) KATAKANA-HIRAGANA PROLONGED SOUND MARK should not continue a Latin script run, but  instead should only continue runs of certain scripts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 3.</strong> Regex property testing.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For many common tasks, the regex expression [:script=Arab:] is too narrow, 
  because it does not include U+060C ARABIC COMMA, but the 
  expression [[:script=Arab:][:script=Common:]] is far too broad, because it also includes 
  thousands of symbols, plus the U+30FC ( ー ) KATAKANA-HIRAGANA PROLONGED SOUND MARK. 
  A regex engine can instead specify a regular expression like [:scx=Arab:], which matches 
  based on the Script_Extensions property value, and which would include 
  <i>appropriate</i> Script=<b>Common</b> characters 
  such as U+060C ARABIC COMMA. For
  more information, see Unicode Technical Standard #18, 
  "Unicode Regular Expressions" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>].</p>
</blockquote>

  <h3>5.4 <a name="Script_Names_in_RegEx" href="#Script_Names_in_RegEx">Using Script 
  Property Values in Regular Expressions</a></h3>
  
  <p>The script property is useful in regular expression syntax for easy 
  specification of spans of text that consist of a single script or mixture 
  of scripts. In general, regular expressions should use specific Script property values 
  only in conjunction 
  with both <b>Common</b> and <b>Inherited</b>. For example, to distinguish a 
  sequence of characters appropriate for Greek text, one might use</p>
  <p align="center"><code>((Greek | Common) 
    (Inherited | Me | Mn)*)*</code></p>
  <p>The preceding expression matches all characters that 
  have a Script property value of <b>Greek</b> or <b>Common</b> 
  and which are 
  optionally followed by characters  
  with a Script property value of <b>Inherited</b>. For completeness, the 
  regular expression also allows any nonspacing or enclosing mark. </p>
  <p>Some languages commonly use 
  multiple scripts, so, for example, to distinguish
  a sequence of characters appropriate for Japanese text one might use:</p>
  <p align="center"><code>((Hiragana | Katakana | Han | Latin | Common) 
    (Inherited | Me | Mn)*)*</code></p>
  <p>Note that while it is necessary to include <b>Latin</b> 
  in the preceding expression to ensure that it can cover the typical script use 
  found in many Japanese texts, doing so would make it difficult 
  to isolate a run of Japanese inside an English document, for example. For more information, see Unicode Technical Standard 
  #18, “Unicode Regular Expressions” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>].</p>
        
    <p>The assignment of a Script property value, and in particular of
    a Script_Extensions property value, is not guaranteed to be stable. The most
    recently published values always represent the best information available at
    the time of publication. It is important not to use the Script or Script_Extensions
    properties in regular expressions if the goal is to match a reproducible, fixed
    set of characters across versions of the Unicode Standard.</p>

  <h3>5.5 <a name="Script_Names_in_Rendering" href="#Script_Names_in_Rendering">Use of the Script Property 
    in Rendering Systems</a></h3>
  
    <p>In rendering systems, it is generally necessary to respect a certain set 
    of orthographic and typographic rules, which vary across the world. For 
    example, the placement of some diacritics which are nominally rendered above 
    their base may be adjusted to be slightly on the side, as is normally 
    the case for Greek. Another example of variation in rendering is the treatment of spaces in 
    justification. In the absence of an explicit specification of those 
    rules, the Script property value of the characters involved provides a good first
    approximation. Typically, a rendering system will partition a text 
    string into segments of homogeneous script (after resolution of the <b>Common</b> 
    and <b>Inherited</b> occurrences along the lines described in the previous 
    sections), and then apply the rules appropriate to the script of each 
    segment.</p>

  <h3>5.6 <a name="Limitations" href="#Limitations">Limitations</a></h3>
  
  <p>The script property 
  values form a full partition of the Unicode codespace, but that partition 
  does not exhaust the possibilities for useful and relevant script-like subsets 
  of Unicode characters.</p>
  <p>For example, a user might wish to define a regular expression to span 
  typical mathematical expressions, but the subset of Unicode characters used in 
  mathematics does not correspond to any particular script. Instead, it requires 
  use of the <b>Math</b> property, other character properties, and particular 
  subsets of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic letters. For information on other 
  character properties, see [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UCD">UCD</a>].</p>
  <p>In texts of an academic, 
  scientific, or engineering nature, 
  Greek characters are frequently used in isolation—for example,  Ω for ohm; α, β, and γ for types of 
  radioactive decays or in names of chemical compounds; π for 3.1415..., and 
  so on. 
  It is generally undesirable to treat such usage the same as ordinary text in the Greek script. 
  Some commonly used 
  characters, such as µ, already exist twice in the Unicode Standard, but with 
  different Script property values.</p>
  
  <h3>5.7 <a name="Spoofing" href="#Spoofing">Spoofing</a></h3>
  
  <p>The Script property values may also be useful in 
  providing users feedback to signal possible spoofing, where 
  visually similar characters (<i>confusable characters</i>) are substituted in 
  an attempt to mislead a user. For example, a domain name such as <code>macchiato.com</code> 
  could be spoofed with <code>macchiatο.com</code> (using U+03BF GREEK LETTER SMALL 
  LETTER OMICRON for the first “o”) 
  or <code>maссhiato.com</code> (using U+0441 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER ES for the first 
  two “c”s). The user can 
  be alerted to odd cases by displaying mixed scripts with different colors, 
  highlighting, or boundary marks: <code>macchiat<span class="lightyellow">ο</span>.com</code> 
  or <code>ma<span class="lightyellow">сс</span>hiato.com</code>, for example.</p>
  <p>Possible spoofing is not limited to mixtures of 
  scripts. Even in ASCII, there are confusable characters such as 0 and O, or 1 
  and l. For a more complete approach, the use of Script property values needs to be augmented with other 
  information such as General_Category values and lists of 
  individual characters that are not distinguished by other Unicode properties.

  Considerations” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTR36">UTR36</a>].</p>
