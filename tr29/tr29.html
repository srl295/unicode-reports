		<h2>
			1 <a name="Introduction" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
			This annex describes guidelines for determining default boundaries
			between certain significant text elements: user-perceived characters,
			words, and sentences. The process of boundary determination is also
			called <i>segmentation</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			A string of Unicode-encoded text often needs to be broken up into
			text elements programmatically. Common examples of text elements
			include what users think of as characters, words, lines (more
			precisely, where line breaks are allowed), and sentences. The precise
			determination of text elements may vary according to orthographic
			conventions for a given script or language. The goal of matching user
			perceptions cannot always be met exactly because the text alone does
			not always contain enough information to unambiguously decide
			boundaries. For example, the <em>period</em> (U+002E FULL STOP) is
			used ambiguously, sometimes for end-of-sentence purposes, sometimes
			for abbreviations, and sometimes for numbers. In most cases, however,
			programmatic text boundaries can match user perceptions quite
			closely, although sometimes the best that can be done is not to
			surprise the user.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rather than concentrate on algorithmically searching for text
			elements (often called <i>segments</i>), a simpler and more useful
			computation instead detects the <i>boundaries</i> (or <i>breaks</i>)
			between those text elements. The determination of those boundaries is
			often critical to performance, so it is important to be able to make
			such a determination as quickly as possible. (For a general
			discussion of text elements, see <i>Chapter 2, General Structure</i>,
			of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].)
		</p>
		<p>
			The default boundary determination mechanism specified in this annex
			provides a straightforward and efficient way to determine some of the
			most significant boundaries in text: user-perceived characters,
			words, and sentences. Boundaries used in line breaking (also called <em>word
				wrapping</em>) are defined in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX14">UAX14</a>].
		</p>
		<p>The sheer number of characters in the Unicode Standard,
			together with its representational power, place requirements on both
			the specification of text element boundaries and the underlying
			implementation. The specification needs to allow the designation of
			large sets of characters sharing the same characteristics (for
			example, uppercase letters), while the implementation must provide
			quick access and matches to those large sets. The mechanism also must
			handle special features of the Unicode Standard, such as nonspacing
			marks and conjoining jamos.</p>
		<p>The default boundary determination builds upon the uniform
			character representation of the Unicode Standard, while handling the
			large number of characters and special features such as nonspacing
			marks and conjoining jamos in an effective manner. As this mechanism
			lends itself to a completely data-driven implementation, it can be
			tailored to particular orthographic conventions or user preferences
			without recoding.</p>
		<p>
			As in other Unicode algorithms, these specifications provide a <i>logical</i>
			description of the processes: implementations can achieve the same
			results without using code or data that follows these rules
			step-by-step. In particular, many production-grade implementations
			will use a state-table approach. In that case, the performance does
			not depend on the complexity or number of rules. Rather, performance
			is only affected by the number of characters that may match <i>
				after</i> the boundary position in a rule that applies.
		</p>

		<h3>
			1.1 <a name="Notation" href="#Notation">Notation</a>
		</h3>
		<p>A boundary specification summarizes boundary property values
			used in that specification, then lists the rules for boundary
			determinations in terms of those property values. The summary is
			provided as a list, where each element of the list is one of the
			following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A literal character</li>
			<li>A range of literal characters</li>
			<li>All characters satisfying a given condition, using
				properties defined in the Unicode Character Database [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UCD">UCD</a>]:
				<ul style="list-style-type: none">
					<li>Non-Boolean property values are given as <i>&lt;property&gt;
							= &lt;property value&gt;</i>, such as General_Category =
						Titlecase_Letter.
					</li>
					<li>Boolean properties are given as <i>&lt;property&gt; =
							Yes</i>, such as Uppercase = Yes.
					</li>
					<li>Other conditions are specified textually in terms of UCD
						properties.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Boolean combinations of the above</li>
			<li>Two special identifiers, <i>sot</i> and <i>eot</i>, standing
				for <i>start of text</i> and <i>end of text</i>, respectively
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example, the following is such a list:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				General_Category = Line_Separator, <em>or</em><br>
				General_Category = Paragraph_Separator, <em>or</em><br>
				General_Category = Control, <em>or</em><br> General_Category =
				Format<br> <i>and not</i> U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)<br>
				<i>and not</i> U+000A LINE FEED (LF)<br> <i>and not</i> U+200C
				ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER (ZWNJ)<br> <i>and not</i> U+200D ZERO
				WIDTH JOINER (ZWJ)
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			In the table assigning the boundary property values, all of the
			values are intended to be disjoint except for the special value <b>Any</b>.
			In case of conflict, rows higher in the table have precedence in
			terms of assigning property values to characters. Data files
			containing explicit assignments of the property values are found in [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Props0">Props</a>].
		</p>
		<p>Boundary determination is specified in terms of an ordered list
			of rules, indicating the status of a boundary position. The rules are
			numbered for reference and are applied in sequence to determine
			whether there is a boundary at any given offset. That is, there is an
			implicit “otherwise” at the front of each rule following the first.
			The rules are processed from top to bottom. As soon as a rule matches
			and produces a boundary status (boundary or no boundary) for that
			offset, the process is terminated.</p>
		<p>
			Each rule consists of a left side, a boundary symbol (see <a
				href="#Table_Boundary_Symbols"><em>Table 1</em></a>), and a right
			side. Either of the sides can be empty. The left and right sides use
			the boundary property values in regular expressions. The regular
			expression syntax used is a simplified version of the format supplied
			in <em>Unicode Technical Standard #18, Unicode Regular
				Expressions</em> [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>].

		<h3>
			1.2 <a name="Rule_Constraints" href="#Rule_Constraints">Rule
				Constraints</a>
		</h3>
		<p>These rules are constrained in three ways, to make
			implementations significantly simpler and more efficient. These
			constraints have not been found to be limitations for natural
			language use. In particular, the rules are formulated so that they
			can be efficiently implemented, such as with a deterministic
			finite-state machine based on a small number of property values.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><i><strong>Single boundaries</strong>.</i> Each rule has
				exactly one boundary position. This restriction is more a limitation
				on the specification methods, because a rule with multiple
				boundaries could be expressed instead as multiple rules. For
				example:
				<ul style="list-style-type: none">
					<li>“a b ÷ c d ÷ e f” could be broken into two rules “a b ÷ c
						d e f” and “a b c d ÷ e f”</li>
					<li>“a b × c d × e f” could be broken into two rules “a b × c
						d e f” and “a b c d × e f”</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li><i><strong>Limited negation</strong>.</i> Negation of
				expressions is limited to instances that resolve to a match against
				single characters, such as “¬(OLetter | Upper | Lower | Sep)”.</li>
			<li><i><strong>Ignore degenerates</strong>.</i> No special
				provisions are made to get marginally better behavior for degenerate
				cases that never occur in practice, such as an <i>A</i> followed by
				an Indic combining mark.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Script boundaries</strong>.</em>
				Script boundaries are treated as degenerate cases in these rules, so
				the string “aquaφοβία” is treated as a single word, and the sequence
				‘a’ + ‘ ि’ as a single grapheme cluster. However, implementations
				are free to customize boundary testing to break at script
				boundaries, which may be especially useful for grapheme clusters.
				When this is done, the Common/Inherited values need to be handled
				properly, and the Script_Extensions property should be used instead
				of the Script property alone.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>
			2 <a name="Conformance" href="#Conformance">Conformance</a>
		</h2>
		<p>There are many different ways to divide text elements
			corresponding to user-perceived characters, words, and sentences, and
			the Unicode Standard does not restrict the ways in which
			implementations can produce these divisions.</p>
		<p>
			This specification defines <i>default</i> mechanisms; more
			sophisticated implementations can <i>and should</i> tailor them for
			particular locales or environments. For example, reliable detection
			of word boundaries in languages such as Thai, Lao, Chinese, or
			Japanese requires the use of dictionary lookup, analogous to English
			hyphenation. An implementation therefore may need to provide means to
			override or subclass the default mechanisms described in this annex.
			Note that tailoring can <i> either</i> add boundary positions <i>or</i>
			remove boundary positions, compared to the defaults specified here.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<span class="note">Notes:</span>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Locale-sensitive boundary specifications, including
					boundary suppressions, can be expressed in LDML [<a
					href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS35">UTS35</a>]. Tailorings are
					available in the Common Locale Data Repository [<a
					href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#CLDR">CLDR</a>].
				</li>
				<li>Some changes to rules and data are needed for best
					segmentation behavior of additional emoji zwj sequences [<a
					href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS51">UTS51</a>]. Implementations are
					strongly encouraged to use the extended text segmentation rules in
					the latest version of CLDR.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			To maintain canonical equivalence, all of the following
			specifications are defined on text normalized in form NFD, as defined
			in Unicode Standard Annex #15, &#x201C;Unicode Normalization
			Forms&#x201D; [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX15">UAX15</a>]. A
			boundary exists in text not normalized in form NFD if and only if it
			would occur at the corresponding position in NFD text. However, the
			default rules have been written to provide equivalent results for
			non-NFD text and can be applied directly. Even in the case of
			tailored rules, the requirement to use NFD is only a logical
			specification; in practice, implementations can avoid normalization
			and achieve the same results. For more information, see Section 6, <a
				href="#Implementation_Notes"><i>Implementation Notes</i></a>.

			3 <a name="Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries"
				href="#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries">Grapheme Cluster Boundaries</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
			It is important to recognize that what the user thinks of as a
			“character”—a basic unit of a writing system for a language—may not
			be just a single Unicode code point. Instead, that basic unit may be
			made up of multiple Unicode code points. To avoid ambiguity with the
			computer use of the term <i>character,</i> this is called a <i>user-perceived
				character</i>. For example, “G” + <i>grave-accent</i>
			is a <i>user-perceived character</i>: users think of it as a single
			character, yet is actually represented by two Unicode code points.
			These user-perceived characters are approximated by what is called a
			<i>grapheme cluster</i>, which can be determined programmatically.
		</p>
		<p>Grapheme cluster boundaries are important for collation,
			regular expressions, UI interactions, segmentation for vertical text,
			identification of boundaries for first-letter styling, and counting
			“character” positions within text. Word boundaries, line boundaries,
			and sentence boundaries should not occur within a grapheme cluster:
			in other words, a grapheme cluster should be an atomic unit with
			respect to the process of determining these other boundaries.</p>
		<p>
			As far as a user is concerned, the underlying representation of text
			is not important, but it is important that an editing interface
			present a uniform implementation of what the user thinks of as
			characters. Grapheme clusters can be treated as units, by default, for processes such as the formatting of drop caps, as well as the implementation of text selection, arrow key movement or backspacing through text, and so forth. For example, when a
			grapheme cluster is represented internally by a character sequence
			consisting of base character + accents, then using the right arrow
			key would skip from the start of the base character to the end of the
		last accent.</p>
		<p>This document defines a default specification for  grapheme clusters. It may be customized for particular languages, operations, or  other situations. For example, arrow key movement could be tailored by language, or could use knowledge specific to particular fonts to move in a more granular manner, in circumstances where it would be useful to edit individual components. This could apply, for example, to the complex editorial requirements for the Northern Thai script Tai Tham (Lanna). Similarly,
	  editing a grapheme cluster element by element
			may be preferable in some circumstances. For example, on a given system the <i>backspace
				key</i> might delete by code point, while the <i>delete key</i> may
		delete an entire cluster.</p>
		<p>Moreover, there is not a one-to-one
			relationship between grapheme clusters and keys on a keyboard. A
			single key on a keyboard may correspond to a whole grapheme cluster,
			a part of a grapheme cluster, or a sequence of more than one grapheme
			cluster. </p>
		<p>Grapheme clusters can only provide an
			approximation of where to put cursors. Detailed cursor placement
			depends on the text editing framework. The text editing framework
			determines where the edges of glyphs are, and how they correspond to
			the underlying characters, based on information supplied by the
			lower-level text rendering engine and font. For example, the text
			editing framework must know if a digraph is represented as a single
			glyph in the font, and therefore may not be able to position a cursor
			at the proper position separating its two components. That framework
			must also be able to determine display representation in cases where
			two glyphs overlap—this is true generally when a character is
			displayed together with a subsequent nonspacing mark, but must also
			be determined in detail for complex script rendering. For cursor
			placement, grapheme clusters boundaries can only supply an
			approximate guide for cursor placement using least-common-denominator
			fonts for the script.</p>
		<p>
			In those relatively rare circumstances where programmers need to
			supply end users with user-perceived character counts, the counts
			should correspond to the number of segments delimited by grapheme
			cluster boundaries. Grapheme clusters<i> may also be</i> used in
			searching and matching; for more information, see Unicode Technical
			Standard #10, &#x201C;Unicode Collation Algorithm&#x201D; [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS10">UTS10</a>], and Unicode Technical
			Standard #18, &#x201C;Unicode Regular Expressions&#x201D; [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
			The Unicode Standard provides default algorithms for determining
			grapheme cluster boundaries, with two variants: <b><i>legacy
					grapheme clusters</i></b> and <b><i>extended grapheme clusters</i></b>. The
			most appropriate variant depends on the language and operation
			involved. However, the extended grapheme cluster boundaries are
			recommended for general processing, while the legacy grapheme cluster
			boundaries are maintained primarily for backwards compatibility with
			earlier versions of this specification.
		</p>
		<p>
			These algorithms can be adapted to produce <b> <i>tailored
					grapheme clusters </i></b>for specific locales or other customizations,
			such as the contractions used in collation tailoring tables. In <a
				href="#Table_Sample_Grapheme_Clusters"><em>Table 1a</em></a> are
			some examples of the differences between these concepts. The tailored
			examples are only for illustration: what constitutes a grapheme
			cluster will depend on the customizations used by the particular
			tailoring in question.

		</p>
		<p>
			A <b><i>legacy grapheme cluster</i></b> is defined as a base (such as
			A or カ) followed by zero or more continuing characters. One way to
			think of this is as a sequence of characters that form a “stack”.
		</p>
		<p>
			The base can be single characters, or be any sequence of Hangul Jamo
			characters that form a Hangul Syllable, as defined by D133 in The
			Unicode Standard, or be a pair of Regional_Indicator (RI) characters.
			For more information about RI characters, see [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS51">UTS51</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
			The continuing characters include nonspacing marks, the Join_Controls
			(U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER and U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER) used in
			Indic languages, and a few spacing combining marks to ensure
			canonical equivalence.
			There are cases in Bangla, Khmer, Malayalam, and Odiya in which a ZWNJ occurs after a consonant and before a <i>virama</i> or other combining mark. These cases should not provide an opportunity for a grapheme cluster break. Therefore, ZWNJ has been included in the Extend class.
			Additional cases need to be added for
			completeness, so that any string of text can be divided up into a
			sequence of grapheme clusters. Some of these may be <i>degenerate</i>
			cases, such as a control code, or an isolated combining mark.
		</p>
		<p>
			An <b><i>extended grapheme cluster</i></b> is the same as a legacy
			grapheme cluster, with the addition of some other characters. The
			continuing characters are extended to include all spacing combining
			marks, such as the spacing (but dependent) vowel signs in Indic
			scripts. For example, this includes U+093F (&nbsp;ि&nbsp;) DEVANAGARI
			VOWEL SIGN I. The extended grapheme clusters should be used in
			implementations in preference to legacy grapheme clusters, because
			they provide better results for Indic scripts such as Tamil or
			Devanagari in which editing by orthographic syllable is typically
			preferred. For scripts such as Thai, Lao, and certain other Southeast
			Asian scripts, editing by visual unit is typically preferred, so for
			those scripts the behavior of extended grapheme clusters is similar
			to (but not identical to) the behavior of legacy grapheme clusters.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the rules defining the boundaries for grapheme clusters, see <i><a
				href="#Default_Grapheme_Cluster_Table">Section 3.1</a></i>. For more
			information on the composition of Hangul syllables, see <i>Chapter
				3, Conformance</i>, of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<i>Note: The boundary between default Unicode grapheme clusters
					can be determined by just the two adjacent characters. See Section
					7, <a href="#Testing">Testing</a>, for a chart showing the
					interactions of pairs of characters.
				</i>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>A key feature of default Unicode grapheme clusters (both legacy
			and extended) is that they remain unchanged across all canonically
			equivalent forms of the underlying text. Thus the boundaries remain
			unchanged whether the text is in NFC or NFD. Using a grapheme cluster
			as the fundamental unit of matching thus provides a very clear and
			easily explained basis for canonically equivalent matching. This is
			important for applications from searching to regular expressions.</p>
		<p>
			Another key feature is that default Unicode grapheme clusters are
			atomic units with respect to the process of determining the Unicode
			default word, and sentence boundaries. They are usually—but not
			always—atomic units with respect to line boundaries: there are
			exceptions due to the special handling of spaces. For more
			information, see <em>Section 9.2 Legacy Support for Space
				Character as Base for Combining Marks</em> in [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX14">UAX14</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
			Grapheme clusters can be tailored to meet further requirements. Such
			tailoring is permitted, but the possible rules are outside of the
			scope of this document. One example of such a tailoring would be for
			the <i>aksaras</i>, or <i>orthographic syllables</i>, used in many
			Indic scripts. Aksaras usually consist of a consonant, sometimes with
			an inherent vowel and sometimes followed by an explicit, dependent
			vowel whose rendering may end up on any side of the consonant letter
			base. Extended grapheme clusters include such simple combinations.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, aksaras may also include one or more additional prefixed
			consonants, typically with a <i>virama</i> (halant) character between
			each pair of consonants in the sequence. Such consonant cluster
			aksaras are not incorporated into the default rules for extended
			grapheme clusters, in part because not all such sequences are
			considered to be single “characters” by users. Indic scripts vary
			considerably in how they handle the rendering of such aksaras—in some
			cases stacking them up into combined forms known as consonant
			conjuncts, and in other cases stringing them out horizontally, with
			visible renditions of the halant on each consonant in the sequence.
			There is even greater variability in how the typical liquid
			consonants (or “medials”), <i>ya, ra, la,</i> and <i>wa</i>, are
			handled for display in combinations in aksaras. So tailorings for
			aksaras may need to be script-, language-, font-, or context-specific
			to be useful.
		</p>

			<p>
				<i>Note: Font-based information may be required to determine the
					appropriate unit to use for UI purposes, such as identification of
					boundaries for first-letter paragraph styling. For example, such a
					unit could be a ligature formed of two grapheme clusters, such as
					لا (Arabic </i>lam<i> + </i>alef<i>).</i>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The Unicode definitions of grapheme clusters are defaults: not meant
			to exclude the use of more sophisticated definitions of tailored
			grapheme clusters where appropriate. Such definitions may more
			precisely match the user expectations within individual languages for
			given processes. For example, “ch” may be considered a grapheme
			cluster in Slovak, for processes such as collation. The default
			definitions are, however, designed to provide a much more accurate
			match to overall user expectations for what the user perceives of as <i>characters</i> than is provided by individual Unicode code points.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<i>Note: The default Unicode grapheme clusters were previously
					referred to as “locale-independent graphemes.” The term cluster is
					used to emphasize that the term grapheme is used differently in
					linguistics. For simplicity and to align terminology with Unicode
					Technical Standard #10, &#x201C;Unicode Collation Algorithm&#x201D;
					[<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS10">UTS10</a>], the terms default
					and tailored are preferred over locale-independent and
					locale-dependent, respectively.
				</i>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			<b><i>Display of Grapheme Clusters.</i></b> Grapheme clusters are not
			the same as ligatures. For example, the grapheme cluster “ch” in
			Slovak is not normally a ligature and, conversely, the ligature “fi”
			is not a grapheme cluster. Default grapheme clusters do not
			necessarily reflect text display. For example, the sequence &lt;f,
			i&gt; may be displayed as a single glyph on the screen, but would
			still be two grapheme clusters.
		</p>
		<p>
			For information on the matching of grapheme clusters with regular
			expressions, see Unicode Technical Standard #18, “Unicode Regular
			Expressions” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
			<b><i>Degenerate Cases.</i></b> The default specifications are
			designed to be simple to implement, and provide an algorithmic
			determination of grapheme clusters. However, they do <i> not</i> have
			to cover edge cases that will not occur in practice. For the purpose
			of segmentation, they may also include degenerate cases that are not
			thought of as grapheme clusters, such as an isolated control
			character or combining mark. In this, they differ from the combining
			character sequences and extended combining character sequences
			defined in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]. In
			addition, Unassigned (Cn) code points and Private_Use (Co) characters
			are given property values that anticipate potential usage.

				Boundaries</a>

		<p>Word boundaries are used in a number of different contexts. The
			most familiar ones are selection (double-click mouse selection or
			“move to next word” control-arrow keys) and the dialog option “Whole
			Word Search” for search and replace. They are also used in database
			queries, to determine whether elements are within a certain number of
			words of one another. Searching may also use word boundaries in
			determining matching items. Word boundaries are not restricted to
			whitespace and punctuation. Indeed, some languages do not use spaces
			at all.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Figure 1</i> gives an example of word boundaries, marked in the
			sample text with vertical bars. In the following discussion, search
			terms are indicated by enclosing them in square brackets for clarity.
			Spaces are indicated with the open-box symbol “␣”, and the matching
			parts between the search terms and target text are emphasized in
			color.

		<p>
			Boundaries such as those flanking the words in <i>Figure 1</i> are
			the boundaries that users would expect, for example, when searching
			for a term in the target text using Whole Word Search mode. In that
			mode there is a match if—in addition to a matching sequence of
			characters—there are word boundaries in the target text on both sides
			of the search term. In the sample target text in <i>Figure 1</i>,
			Whole Word Search would have results such as the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The search term [<font color="#996633">brown</font>] matches
				because there are word boundaries on both sides.
			</li>
			<li>The search term [<font color="#996633">brow</font>] does not
				match because there is no word boundary in the target text between
				‘w’ and the following character, ‘n’.
			</li>
			<li>The term [<font color="#996633">“brown”</font>] matches
				because there are word boundaries between the quotation marks and
				the parentheses that enclose them.
			</li>
			<li>The term [<font color="#996633">(“brown”)</font>] also
				matches because there are word boundaries between the parentheses
				and the space characters around them.
			</li>
			<li>Finally, the term [<font color="#996633">␣(“brown”)␣</font>]
				with spaces included matches as well, because there are word
				boundaries between the space characters and the letters immediately
				before and after them in the target text.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To allow for such matches that users would expect, there are
			word breaks by default between most characters that are not normally
			considered parts of words, such as punctuation and spaces.</p>
		<p>Word boundaries can also be used in intelligent cut and paste.
			With this feature, if the user cuts a selection of text on word
			boundaries, adjacent spaces are collapsed to a single space. For
			example, cutting “quick” from “The␣quick␣fox” would leave
			“The␣&nbsp;␣fox”. Intelligent cut and paste collapses this text to
			“The␣fox”. However, spaces need to be handled separately: cutting the
			center space from “The␣&nbsp;␣&nbsp;␣fox” probably should not
			collapse the remaining two spaces to one.</p>
		<p>
			Proximity tests in searching determines whether, for example, “quick”
			is within three words of “fox”. That is done with the above
			boundaries by ignoring any words that contain only whitespace, punctuation, and similar characters, as in <i><a href="#Figure_Extracted_Words">Figure 2</a></i>. Thus, for
			proximity, “fox” is within three words of “quick”. This same
			technique can be used for “get next/previous word” commands or
			keyboard arrow keys. Letters are not the only characters that can be
			used to determine the “significant” words; different implementations
			may include other types of characters such as digits or perform other
			analysis of the characters.

		<p>Word boundaries are related to line boundaries, but are
			distinct: there are some word boundaries that are not line
			boundaries, and vice versa. A line boundary is usually a word
			boundary, but there are exceptions such as a word containing a SHY
			(soft hyphen): it will break across lines, yet is a single word.</p>
		<p>As with the other default specifications, implementations may
			override (tailor) the results to meet the requirements of different
			environments or particular languages. For some languages, it may also
			be necessary to have different tailored word break rules for
			selection versus Whole Word Search.</p>
		<p>In particular, the characters with the Line_Break property
			values of Contingent_Break (CB), Complex_Context (SA/Southeast
			Asian), and Unknown (XX) are assigned Word_Break property values
			based on criteria outside of the scope of this annex. That means that
			satisfactory treatment of languages like Chinese or Thai requires
			special handling.</p>

			<i>Notes:</i>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>It is not possible to provide a uniform set of rules that
					resolves all issues across languages or that handles all ambiguous
					situations within a given language. The goal for the specification
					presented in this annex is to provide a workable default; tailored
					implementations can be more sophisticated.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>For Thai, Lao, Khmer, Myanmar, and other scripts that do not
					typically use spaces between words, a good implementation should
					not depend on the default word boundary specification. It should
					use a more sophisticated mechanism, as is also required for line
					breaking. Ideographic scripts such as Japanese and Chinese are even
					more complex. Where Hangul text is written without spaces, the same
					applies. However, in the absence of a more sophisticated mechanism,
					the rules specified in this annex supply a well-defined default.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The correct interpretation of hyphens in the context of word
					boundaries is challenging. It is quite common for separate words to
					be connected with a hyphen: “out-of-the-box,” “under-the-table,”
					“Italian-American,” and so on. A significant number are hyphenated
					names, such as “Smith-Hawkins.” When doing a Whole Word Search or
					query, users expect to find the word within those hyphens. While
					there are some cases where they are separate words (usually to
					resolve some ambiguity such as “re-sort” as opposed to “resort”),
					it is better overall to keep the hyphen out of the default
					definition. Hyphens include U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+2010 HYPHEN,
					possibly also U+058A ARMENIAN HYPHEN, and U+30A0 KATAKANA-HIRAGANA
					DOUBLE HYPHEN.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Implementations may build on the information supplied by word
					boundaries. For example, a spell-checker would first check that
					each word was valid according to the above definition, checking the
					four words in “out-of-the-box.” If any of the words failed, it
					could build the compound word and check if it as a whole sequence
					was in the dictionary (even if all the components were not in the
					dictionary), such as with “re-iterate.” Of course, spell-checkers
					for highly inflected or agglutinative languages will need much more
					sophisticated algorithms.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The use of the apostrophe is ambiguous. It is usually
					considered part of one word (“can’t” or “aujourd’hui”) but it may
					also be considered as part of two words (“l’objectif”). A further
					complication is the use of the same character as an apostrophe and
					as a quotation mark. Therefore leading or trailing apostrophes are
					best excluded from the default definition of a word. In some
					languages, such as French and Italian, tailoring to break words
					when the character after the apostrophe is a vowel may yield better
					results in more cases. This can be done by adding a rule WB5a.</p>
				<table class="subtle-nb loose">
					<tr>
						<td class="rule" colspan="4">Break between apostrophe and
							vowels (French, Italian).</td>

				<p>
					and defining appropriate property values for apostrophe and vowels.
					Apostrophe includes U+0027 ( &#39; ) APOSTROPHE and U+2019 ( ’ )
					RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK (curly apostrophe). Finally, in some
					transliteration schemes, apostrophe is used at the beginning of
					words, requiring special tailoring.<br>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Certain cases such as colons in words (c:a) are included in
					the default even though they may be specific to relatively small
					user communities (Swedish) because they do not occur otherwise, in
					normal text, and so do not cause a problem for other languages.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>For Hebrew, a tailoring may include a double quotation mark
					between letters, because legacy data may contain that in place of
					U+05F4 ( &#x05F4; ) HEBREW PUNCTUATION GERSHAYIM. This can be done
					by adding double quotation mark to MidLetter. U+05F3 ( &#x05F3; )
					HEBREW PUNCTUATION GERESH may also be included in a tailoring.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Format characters are included if they are not initial. Thus
					&lt;LRM&gt;&lt;ALetter&gt; will break before the &lt;letter&gt;,
					but there is no break in &lt;ALetter&gt;&lt;LRM&gt;&lt;ALetter&gt;
					or &lt;ALetter&gt;&lt;LRM&gt;.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Characters such as hyphens, apostrophes, quotation marks, and colon
					should be taken into account when using identifiers that are
					intended to represent words of one or more natural languages. See
					Section 2.4, <i>Specific Character Adjustments</i>, of [<a
						href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX31">UAX31</a>]. Treatment of
					hyphens, in particular, may be different in the case of processing
					identifiers than when using word break analysis for a Whole Word
					Search or query, because when handling identifiers the goal will be
					to parse maximal units corresponding to natural language “words,”
					rather than to find smaller word units within longer lexical units
					connected by hyphens.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Normally word breaking does not require breaking between
					different scripts. However, adding that capability may be useful in
					combination with other extensions of word segmentation. For
					example, in Korean the sentence “I live in Chicago.” is written as
					three segments delimited by spaces:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>나는&nbsp; Chicago에&nbsp; 산다.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>According to Korean standards, the grammatical suffixes, such
					as “에” meaning “in”, are considered separate words. Thus the above
					sentence would be broken into the following five words:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>나,&nbsp; 는,&nbsp; Chicago,&nbsp; 에, and&nbsp; 산다.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Separating the first two words requires a dictionary lookup,
					but for Latin text (“Chicago”) the separation is trivial based on
					the script boundary.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Modifier letters (General_Category = Lm) are almost
					all included in the ALetter class, by virtue of their Alphabetic
					property value. Thus, by default, modifier letters do not cause
					word breaks and should be included in word selections. Modifier
					symbols (General_Category = Sk) are not in the ALetter class and so
					do cause word breaks by default.</p></li>
			<li>Some or all of the following characters may be tailored to
				be in MidLetter, depending on the environment:
				<ul>
					<li>U+002D ( - ) HYPHEN-MINUS<br> U+055A ( ՚ ) ARMENIAN

			4.2 <a name="Name_Validation" href="#Name_Validation">Name
				Validation</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Related to word determination is the issue of <em>personal name
				validation</em>. Implementations sometimes need to validate fields in
			which personal names are entered. The goal is to distinguish between
			characters like those in “James Smith-Faley, Jr.” and those in
			“!#@♥≠”. It is important to be reasonably lenient, because users need
			to be able to add legitimate names, like “di Silva”, even if the
			names contain characters such as <em>space</em>. Typically, these
			personal name validations should not be language-specific; someone
			might be using a Web site in one language while his name is in a
			different language, for example. A basic set of name validation
			characters consists the characters allowed in words according to the
			above definition, plus a number of exceptional characters:
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Basic Name Validation Characters</em>

			</a>]</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This is only a basic set of validation characters; in
			particular, the following points should be kept in mind:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It is a lenient, non-language-specific set, and could be
				tailored where only a limited set of languages are permitted, or for
				other environments. For example, the set can be narrowed if name
				fields are separated: “,” and “.” may not be necessary if titles are
				not allowed.</li>
			<li>It includes characters that may not be appropriate for
				identifiers, and some that would not be parts of words. It also
				permits some characters that may be part of words in a broad sense,
				but not part of names, such as in “c:a” in Swedish, or hyphenation
				points used in dictionary words.</li>
			<li>Additional tests may be needed in cases where security is at
				issue. In particular, names may be validated by transforming them to
				NFC format, and then testing to ensure that no characters in the
				result of the transformation change under NFKC. A second test is to
				use the information in<em> Table 5. Recommended Scripts</em> in <em>Unicode
					Identifier and Pattern Syntax</em> [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX31">UAX31</a>].
				If the name has one or more characters with explicit script values
				that are not in <em>Table 5</em>, then reject the name.

		<h2>
			5 <a name="Sentence_Boundaries" href="#Sentence_Boundaries">Sentence
				Boundaries</a>
		</h2>
		<p>Sentence boundaries are often used for triple-click or some
			other method of selecting or iterating through blocks of text that
			are larger than single words. They are also used to determine whether
			words occur within the same sentence in database queries.</p>
		<p>Plain text provides inadequate information for determining good
			sentence boundaries. Periods can signal the end of a sentence,
			indicate abbreviations, or be used for decimal points, for example.
			Without much more sophisticated analysis, one cannot distinguish
			between the two following examples of the sequence &lt;?, ”, space,
			uppercase-letter&gt;. In the first example, they mark the end of a
			sentence, while in the second they do not.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<table class="simple nopad">
				<tr>
					<td>He said, “Are you going?”&nbsp;</td>
					<td>John shook his head.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<br>
			<table class="simple nopad">
				<tr>
					<td>“Are you going?” John asked.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Without analyzing the text semantically, it is impossible to be
			certain which of these usages is intended (and sometimes ambiguities
			still remain). However, in most cases a straightforward mechanism
			works well.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<i>Note:</i> As with the other default specifications,
				implementations are free to override (tailor) the results to meet
				the requirements of different environments or particular languages.
				For example, locale-sensitive boundary suppression specifications
				can be expressed in LDML [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS35">UTS35</a>].
				Specific sentence boundary suppressions are available in the Common
				Locale Data Repository [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#CLDR">CLDR</a>]
				and may be used to improve the quality of boundary analysis.

			6.1 <a name="Normalization" href="#Normalization">Normalization</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			The boundary specifications are stated in terms of text normalized
			according to Normalization Form NFD (see Unicode Standard Annex #15,
			&#x201C;Unicode Normalization Forms&#x201D; [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX15">UAX15</a>]). In practice,
			normalization of the input is not required. To ensure that the same
			results are returned for canonically equivalent text (that is, the
			same boundary positions will be found, although those may be
			represented by different offsets), the grapheme cluster boundary
			specification has the following features:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>There is never a break within a sequence of nonspacing
				marks.</li>
			<li>There is never a break between a base character and
				subsequent nonspacing marks.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The specification also avoids certain problems by explicitly
			assigning the Extend property value to certain characters, such as
			U+09BE (&nbsp;া&nbsp;) BENGALI VOWEL SIGN AA, to deal with particular
			compositions.</p>
		<p>The other default boundary specifications never break within
			grapheme clusters, and they always use a consistent property value
			for each grapheme cluster as a whole.</p>
		<h3>
			6.2 <a name="Grapheme_Cluster_and_Format_Rules"
				href="#Grapheme_Cluster_and_Format_Rules">Replacing Ignore Rules</a>
		</h3>
		<p>An important rule for the default word and sentence
			specifications ignores Extend and Format characters. The main purpose
			of this rule is to always treat a grapheme cluster as a single
			character—that is, as if it were simply the first character of the
			cluster. Both word and sentence specifications do not distinguish
			between L, V, T, LV, and LVT: thus it does not matter whether there
			is a sequence of these or a single one. In addition, there is a
			specific rule to disallow breaking within CRLF. Thus ignoring Extend
			is sufficient to disallow breaking within a grapheme cluster. Format
			characters are also ignored by default, because these characters are
			normally irrelevant to such boundaries.</p>
		<p>The “Ignore” rule is then equivalent to making the following
			changes in the rules:</p>

		<table class="simple">

		<p>The “Ignore” rules should not be overridden by tailorings, with

		<h3><a name="Regular_Expressions"></a>6.3 <a name="State_Machines" href="#State_Machines">State Machines</a></h3>
		<p>
			The rules for grapheme clusters can be easily converted into a regular
			expression, as in <i>Table
				1b, <a
				href="#Table_Combining_Char_Sequences_and_Grapheme_Clusters">Combining Character Sequences and Grapheme Clusters</a></i>. It must be evaluated starting at a known boundary
			(such as the start of the text), and it will determine the next
			boundary position. The resulting regular expression can also be used to generate
			fast, deterministic finite-state machines that will recognize all the
			same boundaries that the rules do.</p>
		<p>
			The conversion into a regular expression is very straightforward for
			grapheme cluster boundaries. It is not as easy to convert the word
			and sentence boundaries, nor the more complex line boundaries [<a
				href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX14">UAX14</a>].
			However, it is possible to also convert their rules into fast,
			deterministic finite-state machines that will recognize all the same
			boundaries that the rules do. The implementation of text segmentation in the ICU library follows that strategy.
		</p>
		<p>
			For more information on Unicode Regular Expressions, see Unicode
			Technical Standard #18, “Unicode Regular Expressions” [<a
				href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>].
		</p>
		<h3>
			6.4 <a name="Random_Access" href="#Random_Access">Random Access</a>
		</h3>
		<p>Random access introduces a further complication. When iterating
			through a string from beginning to end, a regular expression or state
			machine works well. From each boundary to find the next boundary is
			very fast. By constructing a state table for the reverse direction
			from the same specification of the rules, reverse iteration is
			possible.</p>
		<p>However, suppose that the user wants to iterate starting at a
			random point in the text, or detect whether a random point in the
			text is a boundary. If the starting point does not provide enough
			context to allow the correct set of rules to be applied, then one
			could fail to find a valid boundary point. For example, suppose a
			user clicked after the first space after the question mark in
			“Are␣you␣there?␣ ␣No,␣I&#x2019;m␣not”. On a forward iteration
			searching for a sentence boundary, one would fail to find the
			boundary before the “N”, because the “?” had not been seen yet.</p>
		<p>A second set of rules to determine a “safe” starting point
			provides a solution. Iterate backward with this second set of rules
			until a safe starting point is located, then iterate forward from
			there. Iterate forward to find boundaries that were located between
			the safe point and the starting point; discard these. The desired
			boundary is the first one that is not less than the starting point.
			The safe rules must be designed so that they function correctly no
			matter what the starting point is, so they have to be conservative in
			terms of finding boundaries, and only find those boundaries that can
			be determined by a small context (a few neighboring characters).</p>
		<p class="caption">
			Figure 5. <a name="Figure_Random_Access" href="#Figure_Random_Access">Random
				Access</a>
		</p>
		<p align="center" style="text-align: center">
			<img
				src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/images/random_access.png"
				alt="random access diagram">
		</p>
		<p>This process would represent a significant performance cost if
			it had to be performed on every search. However, this functionality
			can be wrapped up in an iterator object, which preserves the
			information regarding whether it currently is at a valid boundary
			point. Only if it is reset to an arbitrary location in the text is
			this extra backup processing performed. The iterator may even cache
			local values that it has already traversed.</p>
		<h3>
			6.5 <a name="Tailoring" href="#Tailoring">Tailoring</a>
		</h3>
		<p>Rule-based implementation can also be combined with a
			code-based or table-based tailoring mechanism. For typical state
			machine implementations, for example, a Unicode character is
			typically passed to a mapping table that maps characters to boundary
			property values. This mapping can use an efficient mechanism such as
			a trie. Once a boundary property value is produced, it is passed to
			the state machine.</p>
		<p>The simplest customization is to adjust the values coming out
			of the character mapping table. For example, to mark the appropriate
			quotation marks for a given language as having the sentence boundary
			property value Close, artificial property values can be introduced
			for different quotation marks. A table can be applied after the main
			mapping table to map those artificial character property values to
			the real ones. To change languages, a different small table is
			substituted. The only real cost is then an extra array lookup.</p>
		<p>For code-based tailoring a different special range of property
			values can be added. The state machine is set up so that any special
			property value causes the state machine to halt and return a
			particular exception value. When this exception value is detected,
			the higher-level process can call specialized code according to
			whatever the exceptional value is. This can all be encapsulated so
			that it is transparent to the caller.</p>
		<p>For example, Thai characters can be mapped to a special
			property value. When the state machine halts for one of these values,
			then a Thai word break implementation is invoked internally, to
			produce boundaries within the subsequent string of Thai characters.
			These boundaries can then be cached so that subsequent calls for next
			or previous boundaries merely return the cached values. Similarly Lao
			characters can be mapped to a different special property value,
			causing a different implementation to be invoked.</p>
		<h2>
			7 <a name="Testing" href="#Testing">Testing</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
			There is no requirement that Unicode-conformant implementations
			implement these default boundaries. As with the other default
			specifications, implementations are also free to override (tailor)
			the results to meet the requirements of different environments or
			particular languages. For those who do implement the default
			boundaries as specified in this annex, and wish to check that that
			their implementation matches that specification, three test files
			have been made available in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Tests29">Tests29</a>].
		</p>
		<p>These tests cannot be exhaustive, because of the large number
			of possible combinations; but they do provide samples that test all
			pairs of property values, using a representative character for each
			value, plus certain other sequences.</p>
		<p>
			A sample HTML file is also available for each that shows various
			combinations in chart form, in [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Charts29">Charts29</a>]. The header cells
			of the chart consist of a property value, followed by a
			representative code point number. The body cells in the chart show
			the <i> break status</i>: whether a break occurs between the row
			property value and the column property value. If the browser supports
			tool-tips, then hovering the mouse over the code point number will
			show the character name, General_Category, Line_Break, and Script
			property values. Hovering over the break status will display the
			number of the rule responsible for that status.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<span class="note">Note:</span><i> Testing two adjacent
					characters is insufficient for determining a boundary, except for
					the case of the default grapheme clusters.</i>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The chart may be followed by some test cases. These test cases
			consist of various strings with the break status between each pair of
			characters shown by blue lines for breaks and by whitespace for
			non-breaks. Hovering over each character (with tool-tips enabled)
			shows the character name and property value; hovering over the break
			status shows the number of the rule responsible for that status.</p>
		<p>Due to the way they have been mechanically processed for
			generation, the test rules do not match the rules in this annex
			precisely. In particular:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The rules are cast into a more regex-style.</li>
			<li>The rules “sot ÷”, “÷ eot”, and “÷ Any” are added
				mechanically and have artificial numbers.</li>
			<li>The rules are given decimal numbers without prefix, so rules
				such as WB13a are given a number using tenths, such as 13.1.</li>
			<li>Where a rule has multiple parts (lines), each one is
				numbered using hundredths, such as
				<ul>
					<li>21.01) × $BA</li>
					<li>21.02) × $HY</li>
					<li>...</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Any “treat as” or “ignore” rules are handled as discussed in
				this annex, and thus reflected in a transformation of the rules not
				visible in the tests.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The mapping from the rule numbering in this annex to the numbering
			for the test rules is summarized in <i><a

		<p align="center">(L+ V+ T*) | (L* LV V* T*) | (L* LVT T*)</p>
		<p>All standard Korean syllable blocks used in modern Korean are
			of the form &lt;L V T&gt; or &lt;L V&gt; and have equivalent,
			single-character precomposed forms.</p>
		<p>
			Old Korean characters are represented by a series of conjoining
			jamos. While the Unicode Standard allows for two L, V, or T
			characters as part of a syllable, KS X 1026-1 only allows single
			instances. Implementations that need to conform to KS X 1026-1 can
			tailor the default rules in <em>Section 3.1&nbsp; <a
				href="#Default_Grapheme_Cluster_Table">Default Grapheme Cluster
					Boundary Specification</a></em> accordingly.

			8.2 <a name="Transforming_Into_SKS" href="#Transforming_Into_SKS">Transforming
				into Standard Korean Syllables</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			A sequence of jamos that do not all match the regular expression for
			a standard Korean syllable block can be transformed into a sequence
			of standard Korean syllable blocks by the correct insertion of
			choseong fillers (L<i><sub>f</sub></i> ) and jungseong fillers (V<i><sub>f</sub></i>
			). This transformation of a string of text into standard Korean
			syllables is performed by determining the syllable breaks as
			explained in the earlier subsection “Hangul Syllable Boundaries,”
			then inserting one or two fillers as necessary to transform each
			syllable into a standard Korean syllable as shown in <a
				href="#Inserting_Fillers"><i>Figure 6</i></a>.
