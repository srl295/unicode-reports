			<i>Client software, such as browsers and emailers, faces a
				difficult transition from the version of international domain names
				approved in 2003 (IDNA2003), to the revision approved in 2010

		<h2>
			1 <a name="Introduction" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
			One of the great strengths of domain names is universality. The URL <span
				class="linkstyle">http://Apple.com</span> goes to Apple&#39;s
			website from anywhere in the world, using any browser. The email
			address <span class="linkstyle"> markdavis@google.com</span> can be
			used to send email to an editor of this specification from anywhere
			in the world, using any emailer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Initially, domain names were restricted to ASCII characters. This was
			a significant burden on people using other characters. Suppose, for
			example, that the domain name system had been invented by Greeks, and
			one could only use Greek characters in URLs. Rather than <span
				class="linkstyle">apple.com</span>, one would have to write
			something like <span class="linkstyle">αππλε.κομ</span>. An English
			speaker would not only have to be acquainted with Greek characters,
			but would also have to pick those Greek letters that would correspond
			to the desired English letters. One would have to guess at the
			spelling of particular words, because there are not exact matches
			between scripts.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most of the world’s population faced this situation until recently,
			because their languages use non-ASCII characters. A system was
			introduced in 2003 for internationalized domain names (IDN). This
			system is called <em>Internationalizing Domain Names for
				Applications</em>, or IDNA2003 for short. This mechanism supports IDNs by
			means of a client software transformation into a format known as
			Punycode. A revision of IDNA was approved in 2010 (IDNA2008). This
			revision has a number of incompatibilities with IDNA2003.
		</p>
		<p>The incompatibilities force implementers of client software,
			such as browsers and emailers, to face difficult choices during the
			transition period as registries shift from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008. This
			document specifies a mechanism that minimizes the impact of this
			transition for client software, allowing client software to access
			domains that are valid under either system.</p>
		<p>The specification provides two main features. The first is a
			comprehensive mapping to support current user expectations for casing
			and other variants of domain names. Such a mapping is allowed by
			IDNA2008. The second feature is a compatibility mechanism that
			supports the existing domain names that were allowed under IDNA2003.
			This second feature is intended to improve client behavior during the
			transitional period. This specification contains both normative and
			informative material. Only the conformance clauses and the text that
			they directly or indirectly reference are considered normative.</p>
		<h3>
			1.1 <a name="IDNA2003-Section" href="#IDNA2003-Section">IDNA2003</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			The series of RFCs collectively known as IDNA2003 [<a
				href="#IDNA2003">IDNA2003</a>] allows domain names to contain
			non-ASCII Unicode characters, which includes not only the characters
			needed for Latin-script languages other than English (such as Å, Ħ,
			or Þ), but also different scripts, such as Greek, Cyrillic, Tamil, or
			Korean. An internationalized domain name such as <span
				class="linkstyle">Bücher.de</span> can then be used in an
			&quot;internationalized&quot; URL, called an IRI, such as <span
				class="linkstyle">http://Bücher.de#titel</span>.
		</p>
		<p>The IDNA mechanism for allowing non-ASCII Unicode characters in
			domain names involves applying the following steps to each label in
			the domain name that contains Unicode characters:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Transforming (mapping) a Unicode string to remove case and
				other variant differences.</li>
			<li>Checking the resulting string for validity, according to
				certain rules.</li>
			<li>Transforming the Unicode characters into a DNS-compatible
				ASCII string using a specialized encoding called <i>Punycode</i> [<a href="#RFC3492">RFC3492</a>].
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			For example, typing the IRI <span class="linkstyle">http://Bücher.de</span>
			into the address bar of any modern browser goes to a corresponding
			site, even though the &quot;ü&quot; is not an ASCII character. This
			works because the IDN in that IRI resolves to the Punycode string
			which is actually stored by the DNS for that site. Similarly, when a
			browser interprets a web page containing a link such as &lt;a
			href=&quot;http://Bücher.de&quot;&gt;, the appropriate site is
			reached. (In this document, phrases such as &quot;a browser
			interprets&quot; refer to domain names parsed out of IRIs entered in
			an address bar <em>as well as</em> to those contained in links
			internal to HTML text.)
		</p>
		<p>
			In the case of IDN <span class="linkstyle">Bücher.de</span>, the
			Punycode value actually used for the domain names on the wire is <span
				class="linkstyle">xn--bcher-kva.de</span>. The Punycode version is
			also typically transformed back into Unicode form for display. The
			resulting display string will be a string which has already been
			mapped according to the IDNA2003 rules. This example results in a
			display string for the IRI that has been casefolded to lowercase:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<span class="linkstyle">http://Bücher.de</span> → <span class="linkstyle">http://xn--bcher-kva.de</span> → <span class="linkstyle">http://bücher.de</span>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			A major limitation of IDNA2003 is its restriction to the repertoire
			of characters in Unicode 3.2, which means that some modern languages
			are excluded or not fully supported. Furthermore, within the
			constraints of IDNA2003, there is no simple way to extend the
			repertoire. IDNA2003 also does not make it clear to users of
			registries exactly which string they are registering for a domain
			name (between <span class="linkstyle">Bücher.de</span> and <span
				class="linkstyle">bücher.de</span>, for example).
		</p>
		<h3>
			1.2 <a name="IDNA2008-Section" href="#IDNA2008-Section">IDNA2008</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			In early 2010, a new version of IDNA was approved. Like IDNA2003,
			this version consists of a collection of RFCs and is called IDNA2008
			[<a href="#IDNA2008">IDNA2008</a>]. IDNA2008 is intended to solve the
			major problems in IDNA2003. It extends the valid repertoire of
			characters in domain names, and establishes an automatic process for
			updating to future versions of the Unicode Standard. Furthermore, it
			defines the concept of a valid domain name clearly, so that
			registrants understand exactly what domain name string is being
			registered.
		</p>
		<p>
			Processing in IDNA2008 is identical to IDNA2003 for many common
			domain names. Both IDNA2003 and IDNA2008 transform a Unicode domain
			name in an IRI (like <span class="linkstyle"> http://öbb.at</span>)
			to the Punycode version (like <span class="linkstyle">http://xn--bb-eka.at</span>).
			However, IDNA2008 does not maintain strict backward compatibility
			with IDNA2003. The main differences are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Additions.</b> Some IDNs are invalid in IDNA2003, but
				valid in IDNA2008.</li>
			<li><b>Subtractions. </b>Some IDNs are valid in IDNA2003, but
				invalid in IDNA2008.</li>
			<li><b>Deviations. </b>Some IDNs are valid in both, but resolve
				to different destinations.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For more details, see <em>Section 7, <a href="#IDNAComparison">IDNA
					Comparison</a></em>.
		</p>
		<h3>
			1.3 <a name="Transition_Considerations"
				href="#Transition_Considerations">Transition Considerations</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			The differences between IDNA2008 and IDNA2003 may cause
			interoperability and security problems. They affect extremely common
			characters, such as all uppercase characters, all halfwidth or
			fullwidth characters (commonly used in Japan, China, and Korea), and
			certain other characters like the German <i> eszett</i> (U+00DF ß
			LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S) and Greek <i>final sigma</i> (U+03C2 ς
			GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA).
		</p>
		<h4>
			1.3.1 <a name="Mapping" href="#Mapping">Mapping</a>
		</h4>
		<p>
			IDNA2003 requires a mapping phase, which maps <span class="linkstyle">ÖBB.at</span>
			to <span class="linkstyle">öbb.at</span>, for example. Mapping
			typically involves mapping uppercase characters to their lowercase
			pairs, but it also involves other types of mappings between
			equivalent characters, such as mapping halfwidth <em>katakana</em>
			characters to normal <em>katakana</em> characters in Japanese. The
			mapping phase in IDNA2003 was included to match the insensitivity of
			ASCII domain names. Users are accustomed to having both <span
				class="linkstyle">CNN.com</span> and <span class="linkstyle">cnn.com</span>
			work identically. They expect domain names with accents to have the
			same casing behavior, so that <span class="linkstyle">ÖBB.at</span>
			is the same as <span class="linkstyle">öbb.at</span>. There are
			variations similar to case differences in other scripts. The IDNA2003
			mapping is based on data specified in the Unicode Standard, Version
			3.2; this mapping was later formalized as the Unicode property [<a
				href="#NFKC_CaseFold">NFKC_Casefold</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that case-folding generates a stable form of a string that
			erases functional case-differences. It is <em>not</em> the same as
			lowercasing. In particular, the lowercase Cherokee characters added
			in Unicode Version 8.0 are case-folded to their uppercase
			counterparts.
		</p>
		<p>
			IDNA2008 does not require a mapping phase, but does <i>permit</i> one
			(called &quot;Local Mapping&quot; or &quot;Custom Mapping&quot;). For
			more information on the permitted mappings, see the <em>Protocol</em>
			document of [<a href="#IDNA2008">IDNA2008</a>], <em>Section 4.2,
				Permitted Character and Label Validation</em> and <em>Section 5.2,
				Conversion to Unicode</em>.
		</p>
		<p>The UTS #46 specification defines a mapping consistent with the
			normative requirements of the IDNA2008 protocol, and which is as
			compatible as possible with IDNA2003. For client software, this
			provides behavior that is the most consistent with user expectations
			about the handling of domain names with existing data—namely, that
			domain names will map consistently both on clients supporting
			IDNA2003 and on clients supporting IDNA2008 with the UTS #46 mapping.</p>
		<h4>
			1.3.2 <a name="Deviations" href="#Deviations">Deviations</a>
		</h4>
		<p>
			There are a few situations where the use of IDNA2008 without
			compatibility mapping will result in the resolution of IDNs to
			different IP addresses from in IDNA2003, unless the registry or
			registrant takes special action. This affects a very small number of
			characters, but because these characters are very common in
			particular languages, a significant number of domain names in those
			languages are affected. This set of characters is referred to as
			&quot;Deviations&quot; and is shown in <em>Table 1, <a
				href="#Table_Deviation_Characters">Deviation Characters</a></em>,
			illustrated in the context of IRIs.

		</p>
		<p>
			The differences in interpretation of Deviation characters result in
			potential for security exploits. Consider a scenario involving <span
				class="linkstyle">http://www.sparkasse-gießen.de</span>, a German
			IRI containing an IDN for &quot;Gießen Savings and Loan&quot;.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Alice&#39;s browser supports IDNA2003. Under those rules, <span
				class="linkstyle">http://www.sparkasse-gießen.de</span> is mapped to
				<span class="linkstyle">http://www.sparkasse-giessen.de</span>,
				which leads to a site with the IP address <strong>01.23.45.67</strong><em>.</em></li>
			<li>She visits her friend Bob, and checks her bank statement on
				his browser. His browser supports IDNA2008. Under those rules, <span
				class="linkstyle">http://www.sparkasse-gießen.de</span> is also
				valid, but converts to a different Punycode domain name in <span
				class="linkstyle">http://www.xn--sparkasse-gieen-2ib.de</span>. This
				can lead to a different site with the IP address <strong>101.123.145.167</strong>,
				a spoof site.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Alice ends up at the phishing site, supplies her bank
				password, and her money is stolen. While the .DE registar (DENIC)
				might have a policy about bundling all of the variants of ß together
				(so that they all have the same owner) it is not required of
				registries. It is unlikely that all registries will have and enforce
				such a bundling policy in all such cases.</p>

		<p>There are two Deviations of particular concern. IDNA2008 allows
			the joiner characters (ZWJ and ZWNJ) in labels. By contrast, these
			are removed by the mapping in IDNA2003. When used in the intended
			contexts in particular scripts, the joiner characters produce a
			noticeable change in displayed text. However, when used between any
			other characters in those scripts, or in any other scripts, they are
			invisible. For example, when used between the Latin characters
			&quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; there is no visible different: the
			sequence &quot;a&lt;ZWJ&gt;b&quot; looks just like &quot;ab&quot;.</p>
		<p>Because of the visual confusability introduced by the joiner
			characters, IDNA2008 provides a special category for them called
			CONTEXTJ, and only permits CONTEXTJ characters in limited contexts:
			certain sequences of Arabic or Indic characters. However,
			applications that perform IDNA2008 lookup are not required to check
			for these contexts, so overall security is dependent on registries
			having correct implementations. Moreover, the IDNA2008 context
			restrictions do not catch most cases where distinct domain names have
			visually confusable appearances because of ZWJ and ZWNJ.</p>

			2 <a name="Compatibility_Processing" href="#Compatibility_Processing">Unicode
				IDNA Compatibility Processing</a>
		</h2>
		<p>To satisfy user expectations for mapping, and provide maximal
			compatibility with IDNA2003, this document specifies a mapping for
			use with IDNA2008. In addition, to transition more smoothly to
			IDNA2008, this document provides a Unicode algorithm for a
			standardized processing that allows conformant implementations to
			minimize the security and interoperability problems caused by the
			differences between IDNA2003 and IDNA2008. This Unicode IDNA
			Compatibility Processing is structured according to IDNA2003
			principles, but extends those principles to Unicode 5.2 and later. It
			also incorporates the repertoire extensions provided by IDNA2008.</p>
		<p>
			Where the transition processing is not needed, UTS #46 can be used
			purely as a preprocessing (local mapping) for IDNA2008 by claiming
			conformance specifically to <em>Conformance Clause <a href="#C3">C3</a>.
			</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			By using this Compatibility Processing, a domain name such as <span
				class="linkstyle">ÖBB.at</span> will be mapped to the valid domain
			name <span class="linkstyle">öbb.at</span>, thus matching user
			expectation for case behavior in domain names. For transitional use,
			the Compatibility Processing also allows domain names containing
			symbols and punctuation that were valid in IDNA2003, such as <span
				class="linkstyle">√.com</span> (which has an associated web page).
			Such domain names containing symbols will gradually disappear as
			registries shift to IDNA2008.
		</p>
		<p>
			Implementations may also restrict or flag (in a UI) domain names that
			include symbols and punctuation. For more information, see <em>Unicode
				Technical Report # 36, Unicode Security Considerations</em> [<a
				href="#UTR36">UTR36</a>].
		</p>
		<p>Using the Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing to transform an
			IDN into a form suitable for DNS lookup is similar to the tactic of
			&quot;try IDNA2008 then try IDNA2003&quot;. However, this approach
			avoids a potentially problematic dual lookup. It allows browsers and
			other clients, such as search engines, to have a single processing
			step, without the burden of maintaining two different implementations
			and multiple tables. It accounts for a number of edge cases that
			would cause problems, and provides a stable definition with
			predictable results.</p>
		<p>The Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing also provides
			alternate mappings for the Deviation characters. This facilitates the
			transition from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008. It is up to the registeries to
			decide how to handle the transition, for example, by either bundling
			or blocking the Deviation characters that they support. The course of
			the transition will also depend on how soon the IDNA2003 client
			software is retired.</p>
		<p>
			The term &quot;registries&quot; includes far more than top-level
			registries, such as for <strong>.de</strong> or <strong>.com</strong>.
			For example, <strong>.blogspot.com</strong> has more domain names
			registered than most top-level registries. There may be different
			policies in place for a registry and any of its subregistries. Thus
			millions of registries need to be considered in a transition
			strategy, not just hundreds.
		</p>
		<p>
			The retirement of IDNA2003 client software may also take considerable
			time. In lookup software, transitions may be fine-grained: for
			example, it may be possible to transition to IDNA2008 rules regarding
			Deviations for <strong>.blogspot.com</strong> at a given point but
			not for <strong>.com</strong>, or vice versa. If <strong>.de</strong>
			bundles or blocks the Deviation characters, then clients could
			transition Deviations for <strong>.de</strong>, but not for (say) <strong>.blogspot.de</strong>.
			Moreover, client software with a UI, such as the address bar in a
			browser, could provide more options for the transition. A full
			discussion of such transition strategies is outside of the scope of
			this document.
		</p>
		<p>During the interim, authors of documents, such as HTML
			documents, can unambiguously refer to the IDNA2008 interpretation of
			characters by explicitly using the Punycode form of the domain name
			label.</p>
		<p>
			There are two slightly different compatibility mechanisms for domain
			names during a transition and afterward. UTS #46 therefore specifies
			two specific types of processing: Transitional Processing (<em>Conformance
				Clause <a href="#C1">C1</a>
			</em>) and Nontransitional Processing (<em>Conformance Clause <a
				href="#C2">C2</a></em>). The only difference between them is the handling
			of the four Deviation characters.
		</p>
		<p>Summarized briefly, UTS #46 builds upon IDNA2008 in three
			areas:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Mapping. </strong>The UTS #46 mapping is used to
				maintain maximal compatibility and meet user expectations. It is
				conformant to IDNA2008, which allows for mapping input.</li>
			<li><strong>Symbols and Punctuation. </strong>UTS #46 supports
				processing of symbols and punctuation during the transitional
				period. The transition will be smooth: as registries move to
				IDNA2008 the DNS lookups of IDNs with symbols will simply be
				refused. At that point, in practice, there is full compatibility
				with IDNA2008.</li>
			<li><strong>Deviations. </strong>UTS #46 provides two ways of
				handling these to support a transition. Transitional Processing
				should <em>only</em> be used immediately before a DNS lookup in the
				circumstances where the registry does not guarantee a strategy of
				bundling or blocking. Nontransitional Processing, which is fully
				compatible with IDNA2008, should be used in all other cases.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For a demonstration of differences between IDNA2003, IDNA2008, and
			the Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing, see the [<a href="#DemoIDN">DemoIDN</a>]. For more detail on the differences,
			see <em>Section 7, <a href="#IDNAComparison">IDNA Comparison</a></em>.
			UTS #46 does not change any of the terms defined in IDNA2008, such as
			A-Label or U-Label.
		</p>
		<p>
			Neither the Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing nor IDNA2008
			address security problems associated with confusables (the so-called
			&quot;<span class="linkstyle">paypal.com</span>&quot; problem).
			IDNA2008 disallows certain symbols and punctuation characters that
			can be used for spoofing, such as spoofs of the slash character
			(&quot;/&quot;). However, these are an extremely small fraction of
			the confusable characters used for spoofing. Moreover, confusable
			characters themselves account for a small proportion of phishing
			problems: most are cases like &quot;secure-wellsfargo.com&quot;. For
			more information, see [<a href="#Bortzmeyer">Bortzmeyer</a>] and the
			[<a href="#IDN_FAQ">IDN FAQ</a>]. It is strongly recommended that <em>Unicode
				Technical Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations</em> [<a
				href="#UTR36">UTR36</a>] and <em>Unicode Technical Standard
				#39, Unicode Security Mechanisms</em> [<a href="#UTS39">UTS39</a>] be
			consulted for information on dealing with confusables, both for
			client software and registries. In particular, [<a href="#UTS39">UTS39</a>]
			provides information that can be used to drastically reduce the
			number of confusables when dealing with international domain names,
			much beyond what IDNA2008 does. See also the [<a href="#DemoConf">DemoConf</a>].
		</p>
		<h3>
			2.1 <a name="Display" href="#Display">Display of
				Internationalized Domain Names</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			IDNA2003 applications customarily display the processed string to the
			user. This improves security by reducing the opportunity for visual
			confusability. Thus, for example, the URL <span class="linkstyle">http://googIe.com</span>
			(with a capital I in place of the L) is revealed as <span
				class="linkstyle">http://googie.com</span>. However, for Deviations
			the distinction between the original and processed form is especially
			important for users. Thus the Nontransitional Processing should be
			used for displaying domain names. This is the same as Transitional
			Processing, except that it excludes the Deviations: ß and ς and the
			joiners. It is thus fully compatible with IDNA2008 for these
			Deviation characters.
		</p>
		<p>Except for direct DNS lookup during the transitional period,
			the Nontransitional Processing should always be used, preserving the
			Deviation characters in the original string as per IDNA2008. Once the
			transition for Deviation characters is over, Nontransitional
			Processing can be used exclusively.</p>
		<h3>
			2.2 <a name="Registries" href="#Registries">Registries </a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			This specification is primarily targeted at applications doing lookup
			of IDNs. There is, however, one strong recommendation for registries:
			<em>do not allow the registration of labels that are invalid
				according to Nontransitional Processing, and for a transitional
				period, bundle or block labels containing Deviation characters.</em>
		</p>
		<p>These tactics can be described as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Bundling</strong>: If the transitional and
				non-transitional forms differ, and are both registered, the
				registrant for each must be the same.</li>
			<li><strong>Blocking</strong>: If transitional and
				nontransitional forms differ, allow the registration of only one,
				and block the others. Registries that do not allow any Deviation
				characters at all count as <strong>blocking</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The label that is actually registered and inserted into a registry
			has always been processed. For example, <span class="linkstyle">xn--bcher-kva</span>
			corresponds to <span class="linkstyle">bücher</span>. However, it may
			be useful for a registry to also ask for "unprocessed" labels, such
			as <span class="linkstyle">Bücher</span>, as part of the registration
			process, so that they are aware of the registrant's intent. However,
			such unprocessed labels must be handled carefully:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Storing the unprocessed label as the sequence of characters
				that the registrant really wanted to apply for.</li>
			<li>Processing the unprocessed label, and displaying the
				processed label to the registrant for confirmation.</li>
			<li>Proceeding with the regular registration process using <em>only
			</em> the processed label.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			2.3 <a name="Notation" href="#Notation">Notation</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Sets of code points are defined using properties and the syntax of <em>Unicode
				Technical Standard #18, Unicode Regular Expressions</em> [<a
				href="#UTS18">UTS18</a>]. For example, the set of combining marks is
			represented by the syntax
			<tt>\p{gc=M}</tt>
			. Additionally, the &quot;+&quot; indicates the addition of elements
			to a set, for clarity.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this document, a <em>label</em> is a substring of a domain name.
			That substring is bounded on both sides by either the start or the
			end of the string, or any of the following characters, called <em>label-separators</em>:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>U+002E ( . ) FULL STOP</li>
			<li>U+FF0E ( ． ) FULLWIDTH FULL STOP</li>
			<li>U+3002 ( 。 ) IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP</li>

			Many people use the terms &quot;domain names&quot; and &quot;host
			names&quot; interchangeably. This document follows [<a
				href="#RFC3490">RFC3490</a>] in use of the term &quot;domain
		name&quot;.</p>
		<p>A <em>Bidi domain name</em> is a domain name containing at least one character 
			with Bidi_Class R, AL, or AN.

			IDNA2003 provides for a flag, <strong>UseSTD3ASCIIRules</strong>,

			the rules in [<a href="#STD3">STD3</a>]. These rules exclude ASCII
			characters outside the set consisting of A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and U+002D (

			Determining what to do with error input is up to the caller, and not
			in the scope of this document. The processing is

			other visual device.</p>
		<p>
			With either Transitional or

			without mapping. In particular, Punycode containing Deviation
			characters, such as href=&quot;<span class="linkstyle">xn--fu-hia.de</span>&quot;

		<p>
			The table specified in <em>Section 5, <a
				title="IDNA_Mapping_Table" href="#IDNA_Mapping_Table">IDNA
					Mapping Table</a></em> may also be used for a pure preprocessing step for
			IDNA2008, mapping a Unicode string for input directly to the

		</p>
		<p>Preprocessing for IDNA2008 is specified as follows:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Apply the <em>Section 4.3, <a href="#ToUnicode">ToUnicode</a></em>
				processing to the Unicode string.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Note that this preprocessing allows some characters that are
			invalid according to IDNA2008. However, the IDNA2008 processing will
			catch those characters. For example, a Unicode string containing a
			character listed as DISALLOWED in IDNA2008, such as U+2665 (♥) BLACK
			HEART SUIT, will pass the preprocessing step without an error, but
			subsequent application of the IDNA2008 processing will fail with an

		<h3>
			4.5 <a name="Implementation_Notes" href="#Implementation_Notes">Implementation
				Notes</a>
		</h3>
		<p>A number of optimizations can be applied to the Unicode IDNA
			Compatibility Processing. These optimizations can improve
			performance, reduce table size, make use of existing NFKC transform
			mechanisms, and so on. For example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>There is an NFC check in <em>Section 4.1, <a
					href="#Validity_Criteria">Validity Criteria</a></em>. However, it only
				needs to be applied to labels that were converted from Punycode into
				Unicode in <a href="#TableDerivationStep3">Step 3</a>.
			</li>
			<li>A simple way to do much of the validity checking in <em>Section
					4.1, <a href="#Validity_Criteria">Validity Criteria</a>
			</em> is to reapply Steps 1 and 2, and verify that the result does not
				change.
			</li>
			<li>Because the four label separators are all mapped to U+002E (
				. ) FULL STOP by <a href="#TableDerivationStep1">Step 1</a>, the
				parsing of labels in Steps 3 and 4 only need to detect U+002E ( . )
				FULL STOP, and not the other label separators defined in IDNA [<a
				href="#RFC3490">RFC3490</a>].
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Note that the input <i>domain_name</i> string for the Unicode IDNA
			Compatibility Processing must have had all escaped Unicode code
			points converted to Unicode code points. For example,
			<code>U+5341</code>
			( 十 ) CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-5341 could have been escaped as any of
			the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><u>&amp;#x5341;</u>&nbsp;an HTML numeric character reference
				(NCR)</li>
			<li><u>\u5341</u> a Javascript escapes</li>

			Section 5, <a title="IDNA_Mapping_Table" href="#IDNA_Mapping_Table">IDNA
				Mapping Table</a>. That table is then normatively used for mapping in <em>Section

			</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The derivation is described as a series of steps. <a

			Steps <a href="#TableDerivationStep2">2</a>, <a
				href="#TableDerivationStep3">3</a>, and <a
				href="#TableDerivationStep4">4</a> define three sets of characters.
			<a href="#TableDerivationStep5">Step 5</a> will modify the base
			mapping or the sets of characters as needed to maintain backward
			compatiblity. The mapping and sets are all used in <a
				href="#TableDerivationStep6">Step 6</a> to produce the mapping and

		</p>
		<p>
			The computation is done twice, once with <strong>UseSTD3ASCIIRules=true</strong>,

			that are <strong>disallowed</strong> with <strong>UseSTD3ASCIIRules=true</strong>,
			but <strong>valid</strong> or <strong>mapped</strong> with <strong>UseSTD3ASCIIRules=false</strong>,
			are given the special values <strong>disallowed_STD3_valid</strong>
			and <strong>disallowed_STD3_mapped.</strong>

		<p>
			If a Unicode property changes in a future version in a way that would

			status in IDNA2003. It also separates buckets where UTS #46 and
		IDNA2008 behave the same from those where they behave differently.</p>
		<p>Each row in the table defines a bucket of code points that

			</li>
			<li>The columns titled <strong>IDNA2003</strong>, <strong>UTS46</strong>,
				and <strong>IDNA2008</strong> show the status of the characters in

				<ul>
					<li>Deviations are modified in Transitional Processing, but
						not modified in Nontransitional Processing; see <em>Section

					</li>
					<li>IDNA2008 uses several subcategories that are grouped

						Other characters are marked as <strong>Disallowed</strong>.

				Implementers</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			<em>Table 4, <a href="#Table_IDNA_Comparisons">IDNA
					Comparisons for Unicode 11.0</a></em> can also be used to categorize implications for
			implementers.
		</p>
		<p>With the exception of Row (g), if any characters are
			Mapped/Ignored in any specification—Rows (d), (e), (k)—then in the
			other specifications they are either Mapped/Ignored in precisely the
			same way, or they are Disallowed. This prevents domain names from
			being mapped differently on different browsers: either the characters
			map to the same result, or they do not work. Row (k) is unproblematic
			in this regard, assuming that registries follow one of the
			specifications, because characters like U+023A ( Ⱥ ) will not be
			valid in registered labels.</p>
		<p>The only exceptions are the four problematic Deviations in Row
			(g), which require more complex handling because of their treatment
			in IDNA2008, as discussed earlier. Transitions for Deviation
			characters will depend upon how registries handle IDNA2008 going
			forward, and how soon IDNA2003 clients are retired. Outside of the
			transition from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008, the UTS #46 Nontransitional
			Processing should be used, thus preserving Deviation characters.</p>
		<p>
			This presumes that IDNA2008 implementations do not use custom,
			incompatible mappings: that is, that they do not take advantage of
			the fact that arbitrary mappings are allowed in IDNA2008, and choose
			a mapping that is incompatible with IDNA2003 or UTS #46. This
			pertains to any of Rows (e), (f), (j), (k). If custom mappings were
			used by any signficant client base, it would result in serious
			problems for security and interoperability. For more information, see
			the [<a href="#IDN_FAQ">IDN_FAQ</a>].
		</p>
		<p>With the exception of the above issues, implementation is
			straightforward:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Rows (a) and (b) are unproblematic. All three specifications
				behave identically.</li>
			<li>Rows (c) and (d) are unproblematic. They contain characters
				that are allowed under IDNA2003, but are disallowed in UTS #46
				because their mappings would be different after Unicode 3.2, based
				on the Unicode Standard mappings. This treatment also matches
				IDNA2008. Those mappings were stabilized some time ago, so mappings
				will not change in the future; see [<a href="#Stability">Stability</a>].
				Fortunately, in-depth analysis of Web content indicates these
				characters are quite rare: their presence in domain names in web
				pages cannot be distinguished from noise (unlike the Deviation
				characters in Row (g)).
			</li>
			<li>Rows (e) and (k) are unproblematic. Ideally, implementations
				will map these characters in IDNA2008, producing precisely the same
				results as in UTS #46, and the same results for Unicode 3.2
				characters as IDNA2003.</li>
			<li>Rows (f) and (j) are symbols and punctuation that are
				disallowed in IDNA2008, but allowed transitionally in UTS #46. Row
				(j) contains post-Unicode 3.2 characters that are handled in UTS #46
				according to IDNA2003 principles. These symbols and punctuation will
				transition smoothly as registries discontinue support for them.</li>
			<li>Rows (h) and (i) are unproblematic. The characters have the
				same status in IDNA2008 and UTS #46.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>

		<p>
			A conformance testing file (IdnaTestV2.txt) is provided for each
			version of Unicode starting with Unicode 6.0, in versioned
			directories under [<a href="#IDNATable">IDNA-Table</a>]. It only
			provides test cases for <strong>UseSTD3ASCIIRules=true</strong>.
		</p>
		<h3>
			8.1 <a name="Format" href="#Format">Format</a>
		</h3>
		<p>The test file is UTF-8, with certain characters escaped using the
			\x{XXXX} convention for readability. The details are in the header of the test file.</p>
    <h3>
			8.2 <a name="Testing_Conformance" href="#Testing_Conformance">Testing Conformance</a>
		</h3>
	    <p>To test for conformance to UTS #46, an implementation will perform the toUnicode, toAsciiN, and toAsciiT
operations on the source string, then verify the resulting strings and relevant status values. The details are in the header of the test file.</p>
<p>Implementations may be more strict than the default settings for UTS46.
  In particular, an implementation conformant to IDNA2008 would disallow the input for lines marked with NV8. Implementations need only record that there is an error: they need not reproduce the precise status codes (after removing any ignored status values).</p>
<h3>
			8.3 <a name="Migration" href="#Migration">Migration</a>
</h3>
<p>The test format and file name changed in Version 11.0 so that it could express a variety of different combinations of input options that people needed. The new format allows the testing implementation to test for precisely the results of its combination of supported flags, by filtering out status codes that correspond to an unsupported input flag. The value  XV8 was also removed, since it was not very useful in practice.
